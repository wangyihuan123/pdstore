The '''Auckland metropolitan area''' (commonly {{pron-en|ˈɔːklənd}}), in the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]], is the largest and most populous [[urban areas of New Zealand|urban area in the country]] with a population approaching 1.4 million residents, {{Decimals|{{formatnum:{{NZ population data||y}}|R}}/{{formatnum:{{NZ population data|New Zealand|y}}|R}}*100|0}} percent of the country's population.{{NZ population data||||y}} Demographic trends indicate that it will continue to grow faster than the rest of the country. Increasingly cosmopolitan, Auckland also has the largest [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] population of any city in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;AAAROUND&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/website/travel/destination/content/?titleid=83&amp;xid=idh185804920_0099|title=Auckland and around|work=[[Rough Guides|Rough Guide]] to New Zealand, Fifth Edition|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has seen many people of Asian ethnicity move there in the last two decades. In [[Māori language|Māori]] Auckland's name is '''Tāmaki-makau-rau''', or the transliterated version of Auckland, '''Ākarana'''.

The 2009 [[Mercer Quality of Living Survey]] ranked Auckland 4th place in the world on its list, while [[Economist Intelligence Unit|The Economist's]] [[World's Most Livable Cities]] index of 2010 ranked Auckland in 10th place.
In 2008, Auckland was classified as an [[Global city|Alpha-City]] in the World Cities Study Group’s inventory by [[Loughborough University]], the only one in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2008t.html | &quot;The World According to GaWC 2008&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Auckland lies between the [[Hauraki Gulf]] of the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the east, the low [[Hunua Ranges]] to the south-east, the [[Manukau Harbour]] to the south-west, and the [[Waitakere Ranges]] and smaller ranges to the west and north-west. The central part of the urban area occupies a narrow [[isthmus]] between the Manukau Harbour on the [[Tasman Sea]] and the [[Waitemata Harbour]] on the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is one of the few cities in the world to have harbours on two separate major bodies of water.

==History==
:''Main article [[History of Auckland]]''

===Early Māori and Europeans===
The isthmus was settled by [[Māori]] around 1350 and was valued for its rich and fertile land. Many ''[[Pā (Māori)|pā]]'' (fortified villages) were created, mainly on the volcanic peaks. Māori population in the area is estimated at about 20,000 people before the arrival of Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= New Zealand|author=[[Ferdinand von Hochstetter]]|year=1867|pages=243 |url=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document/1867_-_von_Hochstetter%2C_Ferdinand._New_Zealand/CHAPTER_XI%3A_The_Isthmus_of_Auckland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkeologi.uu.se/afr/projects/BOOK/Bulmer/bulmer.pdf|title=''City without a state? Urbanisation in pre-European Taamaki-makau-rau (Auckland, New Zealand)''|author=Sarah Bulmer|accessdate=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent introduction of firearms, which began in Northland, upset the balance of power and led to devastating inter-tribal warfare, causing [[iwi]] who lacked the new weapons to seek refuge in areas less exposed to coastal raids. As a result, the region had relatively low numbers of Māori when European settlement of New Zealand began. There is, however, nothing to suggest that this was the result of a deliberate European policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/NgatiWhatua/3/en|title=Ngāti Whātua - European contact|work=[[Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Penguin History of New Zealand|author=[[Michael King]]|isbn=0-14-301867-1|year=2003|pages=135|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Auckland, N.Z.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 January 1832, Joseph Brooks Weller, eldest of the [[Weller brothers]] of [[Otago]] and [[Sydney]] bought land including the sites of the modern cities of Auckland and North Shore and part of Rodney District, for &quot;one large cask of powder&quot; from &quot;Cohi Rangatira&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;George Weller’s Claim to lands in the Hauraki Gulf - transcript of original in National Archives, ms-0439/03 (A-H) HC.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in February 1840, the new Governor of New Zealand, [[William Hobson]], chose the area as his new capital, and named it after [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|George Eden, Earl of Auckland]], then [[Viceroy of India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DOING&quot;&gt;''[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFD6123BF936A15752C1A966958260&amp;scp=31&amp;sq=auckland&amp;st=nyt What's Doing In; Auckland]'' - ''[[The New York Times]]'', 25 November 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The land that Auckland was established on was gifted to the Governor by local Maori [[iwi]] [[Ngati Whatua]], as a sign of goodwill and in the hope that the building of a city would attract commercial and political opportunities for the iwi. Auckland was officially declared New Zealand's capital in 1841,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Tamaki-Makau-Rau to Auckland|author=Russell Stone|publisher=University of Auckland Press|year=2002|ISBN=1869402596}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the transfer of the administration from Russell (now [[Okiato|Old Russell]]) in the Bay of Islands was completed in 1842. However, even in 1840 [[Port Nicholson]] (later [[Wellington]]) was seen as a better choice for an administrative capital because of its proximity to the [[South Island]], which was being settled much more rapidly, and Wellington became the capital in 1865. Auckland was the principal city of the [[Auckland Province]] until the provincial system was abolished in 1876.

===Growth up to today===
In the early 1860s, Auckland became a base against the [[Māori King Movement]]. This, and continued road building towards the south into the [[Waikato]], enabled [[Pākehā]] (European New Zealanders) influence to spread from Auckland. Its population grew fairly rapidly, from 1,500 in 1841 to 12,423 by 1864. The growth occurred similarly to other [[mercantile]]-dominated cities, mainly around the port and with problems of overcrowding and pollution.

Trams and railway lines shaped Auckland's rapid expansion in the early first half of the 20th century, but soon afterward the dominance of the motor vehicle emerged and has not abated since; arterial roads and motorways have become both defining and geographically dividing features of the urban landscape. They also allowed further massive expansion that resulted in the growth of associated urban areas like the [[North Shore, New Zealand|North Shore]] (especially after the construction of the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]]), and [[Manukau City]] in the south.

A large percentage of Auckland is dominated by a very [[suburban]] style of building, giving the city a very low [[population density]]. Some services like public transport are costlier than in other higher-density cities, but Aucklanders are still able to live in single-family dwellings similar to the rest of the New Zealand population, although lot sizes tend to be smaller than many other centres.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:Rangitoto Island North Head.jpg|thumb|left|270px|[[Rangitoto]] island from [[North Head, New Zealand|North Head]].]]
===Volcanoes===
Auckland straddles the [[Auckland Volcanic Field]], which has produced approximately 50 volcanoes. These take the form of cones, lakes, lagoons, islands and depressions, and several have produced extensive lava flows. Most of the cones have been partly or completely [[quarry|quarried]] away. The individual volcanoes are all considered extinct, although the volcanic field itself is merely [[dormant volcano|dormant]].

Unlike the explosive [[subduction]]-driven [[volcanism]] in the central North Island, such as at [[Mount Ruapehu]] and [[Lake Taupo]], Auckland's volcanoes are fuelled entirely by [[basalt]]ic [[magma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith and Allen&quot;&gt;Ian E.M. Smith and Sharon R. Allen, ''[http://www.gns.cri.nz/what/earthact/volcanoes/nzvolcanoes/aucklandprint.htm Volcanic Hazards: Auckland Volcanic Field]'', Volcanic Hazards Working Group, Civil Defence Scientific Advisory Committee. Accessed 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent and by far the largest volcano, [[Rangitoto Island]], was formed within the last 1000 years, and its eruptions destroyed the Māori settlements on neighbouring [[Motutapu Island]] some 700 years ago. Rangitoto's size, its symmetry, its position guarding the entrance to [[Waitemata Harbour]] and its visibility from many parts of the Auckland region make it Auckland's most iconic natural feature. Few birds and insects inhabit the island because of the rich acidic soil and the type of flora growing out of the rocky soil.

[[Image:Auckland20061016222837.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Auckland and the inner [[Hauraki Gulf]] from space.]]

===Harbours and gulf===
Auckland lies on and around an [[isthmus]], less than two kilometres wide at its narrowest point, between [[Mangere Inlet]] and the [[Tamaki River]]. There are two harbours in the Auckland urban area surrounding this isthmus: [[Waitemata Harbour]] to the north, which opens east to the [[Hauraki Gulf]], and [[Manukau Harbour]] to the south, which opens west to the [[Tasman Sea]].

Bridges span parts of both harbours, notably the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] crossing the Waitemata Harbour west of the [[Auckland CBD|Auckland Central Business District]] (CBD). The [[Mangere Bridge (bridges)|Mangere Bridge]] and the [[Upper Harbour Bridge]] span the upper reaches of the Manukau and Waitemata Harbours, respectively. In earlier times, [[portage]] paths crossed the narrowest sections of the isthmus.

Several islands of the [[Hauraki Gulf]] are administered as part of Auckland City, though they are not officially part of the Auckland metropolitan area. Parts of [[Waiheke Island]] effectively function as [[Suburbs of Auckland, New Zealand|Auckland suburbs]], while various smaller islands near Auckland are mostly zoned 'recreational open space' or are nature sanctuaries.

===Climate===
[[Image:Auckland cbd view.jpg|thumb|left|270px|View of the [[Auckland Central Business District|Auckland CBD]].]]

Auckland has a warm-[[temperate climate]], with warm, humid summers and mild, damp winters. Under [[Koppen climate classification|Koppen's climate classification]], the city has an [[oceanic climate]]. It is the warmest main centre of New Zealand and is also one of the sunniest, with an average of 2060 sunshine hours per annum.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIWA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niwascience.co.nz/edu/resources/climate/summary|title=Climate Summary for 1971-2000|publisher=[[National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average daily maximum temperature is 23.7 [[Celsius|°C]] in February, and 14.5 [[Celsius|°C]] in July. The absolute maximum recorded temperature is 32.4 °C&lt;ref name=&quot;high2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10556442|title=Auckland enjoys hottest day ever}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while the absolute minimum is -2.5.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIWA&quot; /&gt; High levels of rainfall occur almost year-round with an average of 1240&amp;nbsp;mm per year spread over 137 'rain days'.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIWA&quot; /&gt; Climatic conditions vary in different parts of the city owing to geography such as hills, land cover and distance from the sea, hence unofficial temperature records exist, such as a maximum of 34°C in west Auckland.&lt;ref name=&quot;high2009&quot;/&gt; On 27 July 1939 Auckland received its only recorded snowfall.&lt;ref name=&quot;snow&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/memwebsite.NSF/Files/Tephra2003-Snowstorms/$file/Tephra2003-Snowstorms.pdf|accessdate=August 2006|title=Snowstorms ([[PDF]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early morning calm on the isthmus during settled weather, before the sea breeze rises, was described as early as 1853: ''&quot;In all seasons, the beauty of the day is in the early morning. At that time, generally, a solemn stillness holds, and a perfect calm prevails...&quot;'' Many Aucklanders used this time of day to walk and run in parks.&lt;ref name=1853_morning&gt;''Auckland, the Capital of New Zealand'' - [[William Swainson (lawyer)|Swainson, William]], Smith Elder, 1853&lt;/ref&gt;

As car ownership rates are very high and emissions controls relatively weak, Auckland suffers from some [[air pollution]], especially with regard to [[fine particles]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.govt.nz/albany/index.cfm?6901EAA9-14C2-3D2D-B939-BF1991A4D1E7|title=Air pollutants - Fine particles (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;)|publisher=[[Auckland Regional Council]]|accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also occasional breaches of guideline levels of [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.govt.nz/environment/air-quality/air-pollutants/carbon-monoxide.cfm|title=Air pollutants - Carbon monoxide (CO)|publisher=[[Auckland Regional Council]]|accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While maritime winds normally disperse the pollution relatively quickly it can sometimes become visible as [[smog]], especially on calm winter days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.govt.nz/environment/air-quality/aucklands-air-quality/aucklands-air-quality_home.cfm|title=Auckland's air quality|publisher=[[Auckland Regional Council]]|accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auckland is home to many cultures. The majority of inhabitants claim [[New Zealand European|European]] - predominantly [[British people|British]] - descent, but substantial [[Māori]], [[Pacific Islander]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] communities exist as well. Auckland has the largest [[Polynesia]]n population of any city in the world and a higher proportion of people of Asian origin than the rest of New Zealand. Ethnic groups from all corners of the world have a presence in Auckland, making it by far the country's most [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] city.

The proportion of Asians and other Non-European immigrants has increased during the last decades due to immigration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/7F0D2AFF-54F4-4CE9-BE7C-974597403FCB/0/Auckland.pdf|format=PDF|title=New Zealand - A Regional Profile - Auckland|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|accessdate=2007-10-03|year=1999|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Immigration to New Zealand|removal of restrictions directly or indirectly based on race]]. Immigration to New Zealand is heavily concentrated towards Auckland (partly for job market reasons). This strong focus on Auckland has led the immigration services to award extra points towards immigration visa requirements for people intending to move to other parts of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/4DAD508D-CC26-425A-A57B-D2AF557C8510/0/1003.pdf Residence in New Zealand] ([[PDF]]) (Page 8, from the [[Immigration New Zealand]] website. Accessed 2008-01-18.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table shows the ethnic profile of Auckland's population, as recorded in the 2001 and 2006 [[New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings|New Zealand Census]]. The percentages add up to more than 100%, as some people counted themselves as belonging to more than one ethnic group. Figures for 2006 refer to the whole Auckland Region, not just the urban area. The substantial percentage drop of 'Europeans' was mainly caused by the increasing numbers of people from this group choosing to define themselves as 'New Zealanders' - even though this was not one of the groups listed on the census form.

The 2006 Census also provides information about the [[multilingual]]ity of the region. 867,825 people in the Auckland Region spoke one language only, 274,863 spoke two, and 57,051 three or more.&lt;ref name=&quot;2006 Census&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:20041216 auckland skyline night.jpg|thumb|270px|right|[[Sky Tower]] illuminated in [[Christmas]] colours during December.]]

===Religion===
Similar to the rest of the country, over half of Aucklanders profess [[Christianity]], but fewer than 10% regularly attend church and almost 40% profess no religious affiliation (2001 census figures). The main denominations are [[Roman Catholic]], [[Anglican]] and [[Presbyterian]]. [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] and [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] churches are the fastest growing. A small community of [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Christians]] is also present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/Africans/2/ENZ-Resources/Standard/4/en Pope Shenouda III visits New Zealand] (from [[Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]. Accessed 2008-05-25.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent immigration from Asia has added to the religious diversity of the city, and about 10% of the population follow such beliefs as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]] and [[Sikhism]], although there are no figures on religious attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/D5B067F9-7A06-483D-A6B9-D438E81ABAC2/0/AucklandCity.pdf|title=What we look like locally|page=7|publisher=Statistics New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a small, long-established [[Judaism|Jewish]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahc.org.nz/intro.php|title=Auckland Hebrew Community ~ Introduction page|accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifestyle==
Positive aspects of Auckland life are its mild climate, plentiful employment and educational opportunities, as well as numerous leisure facilities. Meanwhile, traffic problems, the lack of good public transport, and increasing housing costs have been cited by many Aucklanders as among the strongest negative factors of living there,&lt;ref name=criticisms&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/transport/ctc/theproject.asp Central Transit Corridor Project] ([[Auckland City]] website, includes mention of effects of transport on public satisfaction)&lt;/ref&gt; together with crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/introduction/safer/crimesafety/police.asp|title=Crime and safety profile - 2003|publisher=[[Auckland City Council]]|accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Auckland currently ranks 4th equal in a survey of the [[List of cities by quality of living|quality of life]] of 215 major cities of the world (2009 data).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citymayors.com/features/quality_survey.html City Mayors: Best cities in the world (Mercer)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=top_cities&gt;[http://www.mercer.com/referencecontent.htm?idContent=1173105 Quality of Living global city rankings 2009] ([[Mercer Management Consulting]], Accessed 2 May 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006, Auckland placed 23rd on the [[UBS AG|UBS]] list of the world's richest cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;rich city&quot;&gt;[http://www.citymayors.com/economics/richest_cities.html City Mayors: World's richest cities] ([[UBS AG|UBS]] via www.citymajors.com website, August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:View of Aukland from outside city.JPG|thumb|right|270px|[[Auckland CBD]] from the top of [[Mt Eden]].]]

===Leisure===
Auckland is popularly known as the &quot;City of Sails&quot; because the harbour is often dotted with hundreds of yachts and has more per capita than any other city in the world, with around 135,000 [[yacht]]s and [[Launch (boat)|launches]]. Around 60,500 of the country's 149,900 registered yachtsmen come from the Auckland Region.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10405832 Punters love City of Sails]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Saturday 14 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heraldyacht&quot;/&gt; About one in three Auckland households owns a boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;LIVINGGULF&quot;&gt;{{cite news|page=4|title=The Hauraki Gulf Marine Park, Part 2|newspaper=Inset to [[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Viaduct Basin]] also hosted two [[America's Cup]] challenges ([[2000 America’s Cup|2000 Cup]] and [[2003 America’s Cup|2003 Cup]]), and its cafes, restaurants, and clubs add to Auckland's vibrant nightlife. With the sheltered Waitemata Harbour at its doorstep, Auckland sees many nautical events, and there are also a large number of sailing clubs in Auckland, as well as [[Westhaven Marina]], the largest of the [[Southern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heraldyacht&quot;&gt;''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10365395 Passion for boating runs deep in Auckland]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Thursday January 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yachtingnz.org.nz/index.cfm?pageid=124&amp;languageid=1&amp;siteid=135_1 &lt;nowiki&gt;[Sailing Club] directory&lt;/nowiki&gt;] (from the yachtingnz.org website)&lt;/ref&gt;

High Street, [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]], [[Ponsonby, New Zealand|Ponsonby Road]], and [[Karangahape Road]] are very popular with urban socialites. [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]] and [[Parnell, New Zealand|Parnell]] are up-market shopping areas, while [[Otara]]'s and [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]]'s fleamarkets offer a colourful alternative shopping experience. Newer shopping malls tend to be outside city centres, with [[Sylvia Park]] (Sylvia Park, Auckland City), [[Botany Town Centre, Howick|Botany Town Centre]] (Howick, Manukau City) and [[Westfield Albany]] (Albany, North Shore City) being the three largest.

The [[Auckland Town Hall]] and [[Aotea Centre]] host conferences and cultural events such as theatre, [[kapa haka]], and [[opera]]. Auckland also boasts a full-time professional [[symphonic orchestra|symphonic ensemble]] in the [[Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra]].

Many national treasures are displayed at the [[Auckland Art Gallery]], such as the work of [[Colin McCahon]], while many other significant cultural artefacts reside at the [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]], the [[New Zealand National Maritime Museum|National Maritime Museum]], or the [[Museum of Transport and Technology]] (MOTAT). Exotic creatures can be observed at the [[Auckland Zoo]] and [[Kelly Tarlton's Underwater World]]. Movies and rock concerts (notably, the &quot;[[Big Day Out]]&quot;) are also well patronised.

The Waitemata Harbour has popular swimming beaches at [[Mission Bay, New Zealand|Mission Bay]], [[Devonport, New Zealand|Devonport]], [[Takapuna]], and the west coast has popular surf spots such as [[Piha]] and [[Muriwai]]. Many Auckland beaches are patrolled by [[surf lifesaving]] clubs, which are part of [[Surf Life Saving Northern Region]].

===Parks and nature===
[[Auckland Domain]] is one of the largest parks in the city, close to the [[Auckland CBD]] and having a good view of the [[Hauraki Gulf]] and [[Rangitoto Island]]. Smaller parks close to the city centre are [[Albert Park, Auckland|Albert Park]], [[Myers Park, Auckland|Myers Park]], [[Western Park, Auckland|Western Park]] and [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]].

While most volcanic cones in the [[Auckland Volcanic Field]] have been affected by quarrying, many of the remaining cones are now within parks, and retain a more natural character than the surrounding city. Prehistoric earthworks and historic fortifications are in several of these parks, including [[Mount Eden]], [[North Head, New Zealand|North Head]] and [[One Tree Hill, New Zealand|One Tree Hill]] (Maungakiekie).

Other parks around the city are in [[Western Springs]], which has a large park bordering the [[MOTAT]] museum and the [[Auckland Zoo]]. The [[Auckland Botanic Gardens]] are further south, in [[Manurewa]].

Ferries provide transport to parks and nature reserves at [[Devonport, New Zealand|Devonport]], [[Waiheke Island]], [[Rangitoto Island]] and [[Tiritiri Matangi]]. The [[Waitakere Ranges]] Regional Park to the west of Auckland offers beautiful and relatively unspoiled [[The Bush#New Zealand|bush]] territory, as do the [[Hunua Ranges]] to the south.

;Major events
&lt;!-- Please DO NOT include championships/tournaments where individual games occur in Auckland, unless the finals for example traditionally always occurs in Auckland --&gt;
Popular annual sporting events include:
* The [[Auckland Harbour Crossing Swim]] swim from [[North Shore City]] to the [[Viaduct Basin]], Auckland CBD, is a yearly summer event, covering 2.8&amp;nbsp;km (often with some considerable counter-currents) and attended by over a thousand mostly amateur competitors. It is New Zealand's largest ocean swim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/whatson/events/harbour/default.asp Harbour Crossing] (from the [[Auckland City Council]] website. Retrieved 2007-10-24.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 'Round the Bays' [[road running|fun-run]], starting in the city and going 8.4 kilometres (5.2 miles) along the waterfront to the suburb of [[Saint Heliers, New Zealand|St Heliers]]. It attracts many tens of thousands of people and has been an annual March event since [[Timeline of New Zealand history#1970s|1972]].
* The [[Auckland Marathon]] (and half-marathon), an annual marathon which draws thousands of competitors.

Auckland hosted the [[1950 British Empire Games]] and the 14th [[1990 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games in 1990]],&lt;ref name=&quot;DOING&quot;/&gt; and will host a number of matches (including the semi-final and the final) of the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzrugbyworldcup.com/RugbyWorldCup.aspx|title=Eden Park to host Final and Semi-Finals|date=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
[[Image:Auckland tower.jpg|thumb|270px|right|The [[Sky Tower]] is the tallest free-standing structure in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] at 328m.]]

Most major international corporations have an Auckland office, as the city is the economic capital of the nation. The most expensive office space is around lower [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street]] and the [[Viaduct Basin]] in the [[Auckland CBD]], where many financial and business services are located, which make up a large percentage of the CBD economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;GLANCE&quot;&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/auckland/economy/cbd/glance.asp Auckland's CBD at a glance] (CBD website of the [[Auckland City Council]])&lt;/ref&gt; A large proportion of the technical and trades workforce is based in the industrial zones of [[South Auckland]].

The largest commercial and industrial areas of Greater Auckland are in the southeast of Auckland City and the western parts of Manukau City, mostly bordering the [[Manukau Harbour]] and the [[Tamaki River]] estuary.

The sub-national GDP of the Auckland region was estimated at US$47.6 billion in 2003, 36% of New Zealand's national GDP, 15% greater than the entire South Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/reports/analytical-reports/regional-gross-domestic-product.aspx|title=Regional Gross Domestic Product|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|year=2007|accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auckland's status as the largest commercial centre of the country reflects in the high median personal income (per working person, per year) which was [[NZ$]]44,304 (approx. [[US$]]33,000) for the region in 2005, with jobs in the Auckland CBD often earning more.&lt;ref name=&quot;income1&quot;&gt;[http://www.labourmarket.co.nz/regionalprofile_ak.htm Auckland Regional Profile] (from labourmarket.co.nz, composed from various sources)&lt;/ref&gt; The median personal income (for all persons older than 15 years of age, per year) was NZ$22,300 (2001),&lt;ref name=&quot;income2&quot;&gt;[http://www.emigratenz.org/nz-cities-compared.html Comparison of New Zealand's cities] (from ENZ emigration consulting)&lt;/ref&gt; behind only [[North Shore City]] (also part of the Greater Auckland area) and [[Wellington]]. While office workers still account for a large part of Auckland's commuters, large office developments in other parts of the city, for example in [[Takapuna]] or [[Albany, New Zealand|Albany]], both [[North Shore City]], are slowly becoming more common, reducing concentration on the Auckland CBD somewhat.

==Education==
Auckland has a number of important educational institutions, including some of the largest universities in the country. Auckland is a major centre of overseas language education, with large numbers of foreign students (particularly East Asians) coming to the city for several months or years to learn English or study at universities - although numbers New Zealand-wide have dropped substantially since peaking in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/pasfull/pasfull.nsf/4c2567ef00247c6a4c2567be0008d2f8/4c2567ef00247c6acc2571b900127ca3?OpenDocument Survey of English Language Providers - Year ended March 2006] (from [[Statistics New Zealand]]. Auckland is assumed to follow national pattern)&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, there are around 50 [[NZQA]] certified schools and institutes teaching English in the Auckland area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englishnewzealand.ac.nz/All%20Schools/AUCKLAND.html English Language Schools in New Zealand - Auckland] (list linked from the [[Immigration New Zealand]] website)&lt;/ref&gt;

Auckland has a multitude of [[List of schools in Auckland|primary and secondary schools]]. The city also has several private schools. Auckland contains New Zealand's three largest (by full-time student numbers) high schools: [[Rangitoto College]], [[Avondale College, Auckland|Avondale College]] and [[Massey High School]] respectively. It also contains New Zealand's largest Catholic school, [[St Peter's College, Auckland|St Peter's College]].

Amongst the most important tertiary educational institutes are the [[University of Auckland]] (City, Tamaki, Grafton Campus and satellite campuses) [[Auckland College of Education]] (Epsom and Tai Tokerau Campus), [[AUT]] (City, North Shore and Manakau campus), is New Zealands newest University [[Massey University]] (Albany campus) and the [[Manukau Institute of Technology]] (Otara campus), with [[Unitec New Zealand]] (Mt Albert campus) being the largest technical institute in Auckland.

==Housing==
Housing varies considerably between some suburbs having [[state housing|state owned housing]] in the lower income neighbourhoods, to palatial waterfront estates, especially on the Waitemata. Traditionally, the most common residence of Aucklanders was a bungalow on a '[[quarter acre]]' (1,000 m²).&lt;ref name=&quot;ARCGRO&quot;/&gt; However, subdividing such properties with 'infill housing', has long been the norm. Aucklanders' housing preferences resulting from a lack of apartments and poor public transport has resulted in a large [[urban sprawl]] and reliance on motor vehicles. This will probably continue, as the vast majority of Aucklanders live in low-density housing, which is expected to remain at up to 70% of the total share even in 2050.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARCGRO&quot;/&gt;

In some areas, the Victorian [[villas]] are being increasingly torn down to make way for large plaster mansions with tennis courts and swimming pools. The demolition of the older properties is being combated by the Auckland City Council passing laws that cover heritage suburbs or streets. Auckland has been described as having 'the most extensive range of timbered housing with its classical details and mouldings in the world', many of them Victorian-Edwardian style houses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/documents/district/Part07a.pdf Section 7.6.1.2 - Strategy] ([[PDF]]) (from the [[Auckland City Council]] District Plan - Isthmus Section)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
===Local===
{{See also|Auckland Region|Auckland Council}}

The metropolitan area is made up of [[Auckland City]] (excluding the Hauraki Gulf islands), [[North Shore, New Zealand|North Shore City]], the urban parts of [[Waitakere]] and [[Manukau]] cities, and [[Papakura|Papakura District]] and some urban parts of [[Rodney District|Rodney]] and [[Franklin District]]s. The [[Auckland Regional Council]] is the [[Regions of New Zealand|regional council]] with jurisdiction for the area.

In the late 2000s, New Zealand's central government and parts of Auckland's society felt that this large number of Councils, and the lack of strong regional government (with the [[Auckland Regional Council]] only having limited powers) were hindering Auckland's progress. A [[Royal Commission on Auckland Governance]] was set up in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.stuff.co.nz/0a11.html4147429a11.html Auckland governance inquiry welcomed]'' - [[NZPA]], via 'stuff.co.nz', Tuesday 31 July 2007.

Retrieved 2007-10-29&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 recommended a unified local governance structure for Auckland, amalgamating the Councils.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0903/S00405.htm Minister Releases Report Of Royal Commission]'' - ''[[Scoop.co.nz]]'', Friday 27 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Government subsequently announced that a &quot;super city&quot; would be set up with a single mayor by the time of New Zealand's local body elections in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10565528|title='Super city' to be in place next year, Maori seats axed|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|first=Edward|last=Gay|date=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.nzherald.co.nz/webcontent/document/pdf/Making%20Ak%20Greater%20final%20media.pdf|title=Making Auckland Greater|format=PDF|date=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aspects of the proposed reorganisation [[Auckland Council#Establishment|were or are still controversial]], from the matters such as the form of representation for Maori, the inclusion or exclusion of rural Council areas in the super city, to the role of Council controlled organisations that are intended to place much of the day to day business of Council services at arms length from the elected Council.

===National===
Between 1842 and 1865, Auckland was the capital city of New Zealand. Parliament met in what is now Old Government House on the [[University of Auckland]]'s City campus. The capital was moved to [[Wellington]] in 1865.

Auckland, because of its large population, is currently {{update after|2012|06|reason=Update if new seats established in Auckland region as a result of the 2011 census}} covered by 21 general electorates and three Maori electorates. Prior to 2008, there were only 20 general electorates, with the new seat of Botany being created in 2008 due to the increase in population around Auckland.
As of the 2008 election, thirteen of the seats are held by the governing [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], eight seats (seven general, one Maori) being held by the opposing [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], one seat by the [[ACT Party]], and two seats (both Maori) by the [[Maori Party]].

==Transport==
[[Image:Devonport Wharf Kea Ferry.jpg|thumb|right|270px|[[Ferry]] travel is a popular type of public transport for some Auckland destinations.]]
{{Main|Transport in Auckland|Public transport in Auckland}}

===Travel modes===
;Road and rail
Private vehicles are the main form of transportation, with only around 7% of journeys in the Auckland region being undertaken by bus (2006 data),&lt;ref name=&quot;TRAPLAN&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Auckland Transport Plan - June 2007|year=2007|publisher=[[Auckland Regional Transport Authority]]|pages=8|url=http://www.arta.co.nz/assets/arta%20publications/publications%20page/Auckland%20Transport%20Plan%20June%202007%20-%20section%202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; though these numbers have since increased somewhat. As of 2009 Auckland still ranks quite low in this regard, having only 41 public transport trips per capita per year, while Wellington has more than twice this number at 91, and Sydney has 114 trips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arta.co.nz/assets/arta%20publications/2009/8-0%20134040%20ART%20RTLP%20Draft%202009_hires.pdf Auckland's Transport Challenges] (from the Draft 2009/10-2011/12 Auckland Regional Land Transport Programme, Page 8, [[Auckland Regional Transport Authority|ARTA]], March 2009.

Bus services in Auckland are mostly radial rather than [[Beltway|ring]]-routes, due to Auckland being on an [[isthmus]]. Late-night services (i.e. past midnight) are limited, even on weekends. Trains service the west and southeast of Auckland, with longer-distance options scarce. In 2007 approximately NZ$5.3 billion worth of large-scale projects was underway or planned (and budgeted for) in the Auckland area to improve rail and public transport patronage over the next decade, 31% of the transport budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIKI&quot;&gt;References provided in [[Transport in Auckland]] and [[Public transport in Auckland]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arta.co.nz/xxarta/news/media_releasexx.cfm?entryID=B202280C-BCD4-1A24-99B5-C64E69961830 Auckland Transport Plan landmark for transport sector] (from the [[Auckland Regional Transport Authority]] website, 11 August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; However, policy changes in early 2009 by the incoming National government have meant a shift in emphasis to more highway construction, and have removed the provision of a regional fuel tax that was to pay for [[Auckland Regional Transport Authority|ARTA's]] public transport upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10562220 Hopes of electric trains for cup fade]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Wednesday 18 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While the government has promised to fund the [[Auckland railway electrification|rail electrification]], the process and associated tenders were delayed by approximately one year, and some rail station upgrades and the funding of the [[integrated ticketing]] upgrade were in doubt.

;Other modes
[[Ports of Auckland|Auckland's ports]] are the largest of the country, and a large part of both inbound and outbound New Zealand commerce travels through them, mostly via the facilities northeast of Auckland CBD. Freight usually arrives at or is distributed from the port via road, though the port facilities also have rail access. Auckland is a major cruise ship stopover point, with the ships usually tying up at [[Princes Wharf]]. Auckland CBD is connected to coastal suburbs, to [[North Shore City]] and to outlying islands by ferry.

Auckland has various small regional airports and [[Auckland Airport]], the busiest of the country.

;Policies
Research at [[Griffith University]] has indicated that in the last 50 years, Auckland has engaged in some of the most pro-automobile transport policies anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;GRIFF&quot;&gt;''[http://www.griffith.edu.au/centre/urp/urp_publications/Issues_Papers/URP_IP5_MeesDodsonAucklandTransport_April, 2006.pdf Backtracking Auckland: Bureaucratic rationality and public preferences in transport planning]'' - Mees, Paul; Dodson, Jago; Urban Research Program Issues Paper 5, [[Griffith University]], April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; With public transport declining heavily during the second half of the 20th century (a trend mirrored in most Western countries such as the US),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicpurpose.com/ut-usptshare45.htm US Urban Personal Vehicle &amp; Public Transport Market Share from 1900] (from publicpurpose.com, a website of the [[Wendell Cox]] Consultancy)&lt;/ref&gt; and increased spending on roads and cars, New Zealand (and specifically Auckland) now has the second-highest vehicle ownership rate in the world, with around 578 vehicles per 1000 people.&lt;ref name=vehicle_ownership&gt;[http://www.northshorecity.govt.nz/ Sustainable Transport] North Shore City Council website&lt;/ref&gt; Auckland has also been called a very pedestrian- and cyclist-unfriendly city, though some efforts are being made to change this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Big steps to change City of Cars&quot;&gt;''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10539171 Big steps to change City of Cars]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Friday October 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Big steps to change City of Cars&quot;/&gt; At the same, high-profile gaps in the network, such as the inability for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the Waitemata Harbour, will probably remain for the foreseeable future, with councils generally not considering the costs involved as sensible expense.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10530271 Cycleway for bridge could prove too pricey]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Wednesday 3 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrastructure===
The [[New Zealand State Highway network|State Highway network]] connects the cities in the Auckland urban area through the Northern, Southern, Northwestern and Southwestern Motorways.

The [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] (Northern Motorway) is the main connection to [[North Shore City]], and also a major traffic bottleneck. The Harbour Bridge does not provide access for rail, pedestrians or cyclists, which has repeatedly (most recently in 2008) led to campaigns for and investigations into retrofitting the structure.

The [[Central Motorway Junction]], also called 'Spaghetti Junction' for its complexity, is the intersection between the two major motorways of Auckland (State Highway 1 and State Highway 16).

Two of the longest arterial roads within Greater Auckland are [[Great North Road, New Zealand|Great North Road]] and [[Great South Road, New Zealand|Great South Road]] - the main connections in those directions before the construction of the State Highway network.

Auckland has three main railway lines, serving the general western, southern, and central eastern directions from the [[Britomart Transport Centre]] in downtown Auckland. It is the terminal station for all lines, and connects them to ferry and bus services.

==Future growth==

[[Image:AucklandMuseum edit gobeirne.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]].]]

Auckland is expecting substantial population growth via immigration and natural population increases (which contribute to growth at about one-third and two-thirds, respectively)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arc.govt.nz/arc/auckland-region/growth/can-we-stop-growth.cfm Can We Stop growth?] (from the [[Auckland Regional Council|ARC]] website)&lt;/ref&gt;, and is set to grow to an estimated 1.9 million inhabitants by 2031.&lt;ref name=&quot;STATSNZPOP&quot;&gt;[http://www.stats.govt.nz/Publications/PopulationStatistics/mapping-trends-in-the-auckland-region/population-change.aspx Statistics New Zealand] [[Statistics New Zealand|]], 2010. Retrieved 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ARCGRO&quot;&gt;[http://www.arc.govt.nz/albany/fms/main/Documents/Auckland/Aucklands%20growth/Auckland%20regional%20growth%20strategy.pdf Executive Summary] ([[PDF]]) (from the Auckland Regional Growth Strategy document, [[Auckland Regional Council|ARC]], November 1999. Retrieved 2007-10-14.)&lt;/ref&gt; This substantial increase in population will have a major impact on transport, housing and other infrastructure that is in many cases already considered under pressure. It is also feared by some organisations, such as the [[Auckland Regional Council]], that [[urban sprawl]] will result from the growth and, as a result, that it is necessary to address this proactively in planning [[policy]].

A 'Regional Growth Strategy' has been adopted that sees limits on further subdivision and intensification of existing use as its main [[sustainability]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://portal.jarbury.net/thesis.pdf From Urban Sprawl to Compact City: an analysis of Auckland's Urban Growth Management Strategies]'' - Arbury, Joshua - MA Thesis, University of Auckland&lt;/ref&gt; This policy is contentious, as it naturally limits the uses of private land, especially the subdivision of urban fringe properties,&lt;ref name=&quot;GREEN&quot;&gt;''[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=139&amp;objectid=10436540 Green belt under siege]'' - ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Saturday 28 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; by setting 'Metropolitan Urban Limits' in planning documents like the [[District Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/documents/growthstrategy/docs/Glossary.pdf Growth Strategy: Glossary and References] ([[PDF]]) (from the [[Auckland City Council]])&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2006 Census projections, the medium-variant scenario shows that the population is projected to continue growing, to reach 1.93 million by 2031. The high-variant scenario shows the region's population growing to over two million by 2031.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Publications/PopulationStatistics/mapping-trends-in-the-auckland-region/population-change.aspx|title=Mapping Trends in the Auckland Region|work=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Berlin}}

The name ''Berlin'' is of unknown origin, but may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' &quot;swamp&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=3411062525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ZLB-Berliner Ansichten-Januar.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Berlin in 1688]]

The earliest evidence of settlements in today's Berlin central areas is a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192.&lt;ref name = &quot;zycwaq&quot;&gt;{{citenews|work=Associated Press|title=Berlin dig finds city older than thought|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first written mention of towns in the area of present-day Berlin dates from the late 12th century. The settlement of [[Spandau]] is first mentioned in 1197, and [[Köpenick]] in 1209, though these areas did not join Berlin until 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/tourismus/sehenswuerdigkeiten.en/00175.html|title=Spandau Citadel|work=Berlin tourist board|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. [[Cölln]] on the [[Fischerinsel]] is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the [[Spree]] in what is now called the [[Nikolaiviertel]], is referenced in a document from 1244.&lt;ref name = &quot;zycwaq&quot;/&gt; The former is considered to be the &quot;founding date&quot;. From the beginning, the two cities formed an economic and social unit. In 1307, the two cities were united politically. Over time, the twin cities came to be known simply as Berlin.

In 1435, [[Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg|Frederick I]] became the [[prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which he ruled until 1440.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html|title=The Hohenzollern Dynasty|work=Antipas|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II Irontooth]], established Berlin as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the [[Hohenzollern]] family ruled until 1918 in Berlin, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and finally as [[German emperor]]s. In 1448 citizens rebelled in the &quot;Berlin Indignation&quot; against the construction of a new royal palace by Frederick II Irontooth. This protest was not successful, however, and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. In 1451 Berlin became the royal residence of the Brandenburg electors, and Berlin had to give up its status as a free [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became [[Lutheran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smp-protein.de/SMPConference/berlin.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060818100934/http://www.smp-protein.de/SMPConference/berlin.htm|archivedate=18 August 2006|title=Berlin Cathedral|work=SMPProtein|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th to 19th centuries===
[[File:Friedrich Zweite Alt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frederick the Great]] (1712–1786) was one of Europe's [[enlightened monarch]]s.]]

The [[Thirty Years' War]] between 1618 and 1648 had devastating consequences for Berlin. A third of the houses were damaged and the city lost half of its population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/germany/bra30.html|title=Brandenburg during the 30 Years War|work=WHKMLA|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], known as the &quot;Great Elector&quot;, who had succeeded his father [[George William of Brandenburg|George William]] as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance. With the [[Edict of Potsdam]] in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French [[Huguenot]]s. More than 15,000 Huguenots went to Brandenburg, of whom 6,000 settled in Berlin. By 1700, approximately 20 percent of Berlin's residents were French, and their cultural influence on the city was immense. Many other immigrants came from [[Bohemia]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], and [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]].

[[File:Berlin Unter den Linden Victoria Hotel um 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin became the capital of the German Empire in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years. (Unter den Linden in 1900)]]

With the coronation of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]] in 1701 as king (in [[Königsberg]]), Berlin became the new capital of the Kingdom of Prussia (instead of [[Königsberg]]); this was a successful attempt to centralize the capital in the very outspread Prussian Kingdom, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1740 Frederick II, known as [[Frederick the Great]] (1740–1786), came to power. Berlin became, under the rule of the philosophically oriented Frederick II, a center of [[the Enlightenment]]. Following [[First French Empire|France's]] victory in the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] marched into Berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city. In 1815 the city became part of the new [[Province of Brandenburg]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main rail hub and economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, outlying suburbs including [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], [[Moabit]], and several others were incorporated into Berlin. In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded German Empire. On 1 April 1881 it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.

===20th century===
[[File:Potsdamer Platz 1945.jpg|thumb|Berlin in ruins after [[World War II]] (Potsdamer Platz, 1945).]]

At the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, the Weimar Republic was proclaimed in Berlin. In 1920, the [[Greater Berlin Act]] incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. This new area encompassed Spandau and Charlottenberg in the west, as well as several other areas that are now major municipalities. After this expansion, Berlin had a population of around four million. During the Weimar era, Berlin became internationally renowned as a center of cultural transformation, at the heart of the [[Roaring Twenties]].

On 30 January 1933 ([[Machtergreifung]]), [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] came to power. Nazi rule destroyed Berlin's Jewish community, which had numbered 170,000 before 1933. After the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom in 1938, thousands of the city's German Jews were imprisoned in the nearby [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] or, in early 1943, were shipped to [[death camp]]s, such as [[Auschwitz]]. During the Second World War, large parts of Berlin were destroyed in [[Battle of Berlin (air)|the 1943–45 air raids]] and during the [[Battle of Berlin]]. Among the hundreds of thousands who died during the Battle for Berlin, an estimated 125,000 were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Clodfelter|first=Michael|title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts- A Statistical Reference to Casualty and Other Figures, 1500-2000|edition=2nd|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2002|isbn=0786412046}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[end of World War II in Europe|end of the war in Europe]] in 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zones]] into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the Western Allies (the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and France) formed [[West Berlin]], while the [[Soviet Union|Soviet sector]] formed [[East Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t297c01.html|title=Agreement to divide Berlin|work=FDR-Library|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlinermauer.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Berlin Wall]] in 1986, painted on the western side. People crossing the so-called &quot;death strip&quot; on the eastern side were at risk of being shot.]]

All four allies retained shared responsibility for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the [[USSR|Soviet Union]] imposed a [[Berlin Blockade|blockade]] on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet controlled territory. The allies successfully overcame the blockade by the [[Berlin airlift]], which flew in food and other supplies to the city from 24 June 1948 to 11 May 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|title=Berlin Airlift / Blockade|work=Western Allies Berlin|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in West Germany, and eventually included all of the American, British, and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the [[Marxist-Leninist]] German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but for all practical purposes, it was assimilated to the Federal Republic of Germany without actually being a part of it. West Berlin issued its own postage stamps which were often the same as West German postage stamps but with the additional word 'Berlin' added. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British, and French airlines.

[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.]]

The founding of the two German states increased [[Cold War]] tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory. East Germany, however, proclaimed East Berlin (which it described only as &quot;Berlin&quot;) as its capital, a move that was not recognized by the Western powers. Although half the size and population of West Berlin, it included most of the historic center of the city. The West German government, meanwhile, established itself provisionally in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/1945.en.html|title=Berlin official website; History after 1945|work=City of Berlin|accessdate=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tensions between east and west culminated in the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] between East and West Berlin and other barriers around West Berlin by East Germany on 13 August 1961 and were exacerbated by a tank standoff at [[Checkpoint Charlie]] on 27 October 1961. West Berlin was now [[de facto]] a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany.

[[File:Berlin skyline 2009w.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Berlin Mitte in the 21st century.]]

Berlin was completely separated. It was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other only through strictly controlled checkpoints. For most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was no longer possible. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power agreement]] guaranteed access across East Germany to West Berlin and ended the potential for harassment or closure of the routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga5-710903.htm|title=Ostpolitik: The Quadripartite Agreement of September 3, 1971|work=US Berlin Embassy|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, pressure from the East German population broke free across the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989, which was subsequently mostly demolished. Not much is left of it today; the [[East Side Gallery]] in [[Friedrichshain]] near the ''Oberbaumbrücke'' over the Spree preserves a portion of the Wall. Democracy and market economy changed East Germany and East Berlin.

On 3 October 1990 the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin became the German capital according to the unification treaty. In June 1991 the German Parliament, the [[Bundestag]], voted to move the (West) German capital back from Bonn to Berlin. In 1999, the German parliament and government began their work in Berlin.

==Geography==
[[File:Berlin.svg|thumb|Natural and built environment.]]

Berlin is located in eastern Germany, about {{convert|70|km|sp=us}} west of the border with Poland in an area with marshy terrain. The Berlin–Warsaw ''Urstromtal'' (ice age melt water flow), between the low Barnim plateau to the north and the Teltow plateau to the south, was formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last ice age. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In [[Spandau]], Berlin's westernmost borough, the Spree meets the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and [[Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&amp;spn=0.060339,0.085316&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en|title=Satellite Image Berlin|work=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Über den Dächern von Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|View over central Berlin.]]

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim plateau, while most of the boroughs [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow plateau. The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin ''Urstromtal'' and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. The highest elevations in Berlin are the [[Teufelsberg]] and the [[Müggelberge]]. Both hills have an elevation of about {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The Teufelsberg is in fact an artificial pile of rubble from the ruins of World War II.

===Climate===
[[File:Potsdam view from above.jpg|thumb|The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes]]
Berlin has an [[Oceanic climate]] (Cfb) according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system. The city features a [[temperate climate]].

Summers are warm with average high temperatures of {{convert|22|-|25|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|12|-|14|C|F}}. Winters are cold with average high temperatures of {{convert|4|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|-2|to|0|C|F}}. Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with heat stored by the city's buildings. Temperatures can be {{convert|4|C-change|sigfig=1}} higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;www.weather.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual precipitation is {{convert|570|mm|in|sp=us}} with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through March, but snow cover does not usually remain for long. The recent winter of 2009/2010 was an exception as there was a permanent snow cover from late December till early March.&lt;ref name=worldweather&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweather.org/016/c00059.htm|title=Climate figures|work=World Weather Information Service|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cityscape==
[[File:Berlin night.jpg|thumb|right|Berlin along the Spree river and the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] by night.]]

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the twentieth century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin&amp;#8203;—&amp;#8203;the 1871 German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany&amp;#8203;—&amp;#8203;initiated ambitious construction programs, each with its own distinctive character. Berlin was devastated by bombing raids during World War II and many of the old buildings that escaped the bombs were eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s in both West and East. Much of this destruction was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads.

In the eastern part, many ''[[Plattenbau]]ten'' can be found, reminders of [[Eastern Bloc]] ambitions to create complete residential areas with fixed ratios of shops, kindergartens and schools. Berlin's unique recent history has left the city with a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings.

===Architecture===
[[File:Berlin - Haus des Lehrers &amp; BCC.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Haus des Lehrers&quot; and Congress Hall at Alexanderplatz.]]

The [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is the second-tallest structure in the European Union at {{m to ft|368|precision=0}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the Socialist Classicism Style of the [[Stalin]] era. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. The previously built-up part in front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological scene.

[[File:Brandenburger Tor 2005 006.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Brandenburg Gate]].]]
The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division. It has recently undergone a restoration.

The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany. It also appears on German [[euro]] coins (10&amp;nbsp;cent, 20&amp;nbsp;cent, and 50&amp;nbsp;cent). The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament, renovated in the 1950s after severe World War II damage. The building was again remodeled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

[[File:PotsdamerplatzBerlin.JPG|thumb|right|[[Potsdamer Platz]] at dusk.]]
The [[Gendarmenmarkt]], a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin whose name dates back to the Napoleonic occupation of the city, is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the German Cathedral. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

The [[Berliner Dom]], a Protestant cathedral and the third church on this site, is located on the [[Museum Island|Spree Island]] across from the site of the [[Berliner Stadtschloss]] and adjacent to the [[Lustgarten]]. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. Like many other buildings, it suffered extensive damage during the Second World War. The [[Cathedral of St. Hedwig]] is Berlin's [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral.

[[File:ReichstagDomeInside.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Inside the glass dome of the Reichstag.]]

[[Unter den Linden]] is a tree lined east-west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street and part of [[Humboldt University]] is located there. [[Friedrichstraße]] was Berlin's legendary street during the [[Roaring Twenties]]. It combines twentieth century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

[[Potsdamer Platz]] is an entire quarter built from scratch after 1995 after the Wall came down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html|title=Construction and redevelopment since 1990|work=Senate Department of Urban Development|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the [[Gemäldegalerie (Berlin)|Gemäldegalerie]], and is flanked by the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Berliner Philharmonie]]. The [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], a [[Holocaust]] memorial, is situated to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/arts/design/09holo.html?ex=1162962000&amp;en=272335914d8b80d6&amp;ei=5070|title=A Forest of Pillars, Recalling the Unimaginable|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=18 August 2008|first=Nicolai|last=Ouroussoff|date=9 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area around Hackescher Markt is home to the fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the Hackesche Höfe, a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. Oranienburger Straße and the nearby [[New Synagogue (Berlin)|New Synagogue]] were the center of Jewish culture before 1933, and they have regained that status today.

[[File:Schloss Charlottenburg 2005 282.JPG|thumb|[[Schloss Charlottenburg]] is the largest existing palace in Berlin.]]

The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as central East-West-Axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately half-way from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Near by on Tauentzienstraße is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous &quot;[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!&quot; speech, is situated in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].

West of the center, [[Schloss Bellevue]] is the residence of the German President. [[Schloss Charlottenburg]], which was burnt out in the Second World War and largely destroyed, has been rebuilt and is the largest surviving historical palace in Berlin.

The [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower at the fair area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators, and has a restaurant {{m to ft|55|precision=0|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{m to ft|126|precision=0|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

==Government==
[[File:Reichstag building Berlin view from west before sunset.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] is the site of the German parliament.]]

Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany and is the seat of the [[President of Germany]], whose official residence is [[Schloss Bellevue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundespraesident.de/en Bundespräsident Horst Köhler], www.bundespraesident.de. Retrieved 12 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Since German reunification on 3 October 1990, it has been one of the three city states, together with [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], among the present sixteen states of Germany. The [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] (&quot;federal council&quot;) is the representation of the Federal States (''Bundesländer'') of Germany and has its seat at the former Prussian [[Herrenhaus]] (House of Lords). Though most of the ministries are seated in Berlin, some of them, as well as some minor departments, are seated in Bonn, the former capital of West Germany. The [[European Union]] invests in several projects within the city of Berlin. Infrastructure, education and social programs are co-financed with budgets taken from EU cohesion funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erasmuspc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=303&amp;Itemid=61 URBAN regeneration, a European Commission initiative], ErasmusPC.

===City state===
[[File:Wowereit2008.JPG|upright|thumb|Governing Mayor since 2001, [[Klaus Wowereit]]]]

The city and state parliament is the [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]] (''Abgeordnetenhaus''), which currently has 141 seats. Berlin's [[executive (government)|executive]] body is the Senate of Berlin (''Senat von Berlin''). The Senate of Berlin consists of the [[List of mayors of Berlin|Governing Mayor]] (''Regierender Bürgermeister'') and up to eight senators holding ministerial positions, one of them holding the official title &quot;Mayor&quot; (''Bürgermeister'') as deputy to the Governing Mayor. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the [[Berlin state election, 2001|2001 state election]] and won another term in the [[Berlin state election, 2006|2006 state election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-berlin.de/wahlen/|title=Berlin state election, 2006|work=Der Landeswahlleiter für Berlin|accessdate=17 August 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the city (''Oberbürgermeister der Stadt'') and Prime Minister of the Federal State (''Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes''). The office of Berlin's Governing Mayor is in the [[Rotes Rathaus|Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall)]]. Since 2001 this office has been held by [[Klaus Wowereit]] of the SPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/050516/wowereit.html|title=The Glamor Guy|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Europe]]|date=8 May 2005|accessdate=17 August 2008}} See also: {{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/23/world/europe/23wowereit.html?ex=1161489600&amp;en=2129daf9965bf613&amp;ei=5070|title=Berlin Mayor, Symbol of Openness, Has National Appeal|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=17 August 2008|first=Mark|last=Landler|date=23 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's government is based on a coalition between the Social Democratic Party and The Left.

The total annual state budget of Berlin in 2007 exceeded €20.5 ($28.7) billion including a budget surplus of €80 ($112) million. The figures indicate the first surplus in the history of the city state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,527721,00.html Berlin schafft erstes Etatplus seit dem Krieg](German), SpiegelOnline. Retrieved February, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to increasing growth rates and tax revenues, the Senate of Berlin calculates an increasing budget surplus in 2008. The total budget includes an estimated amount of €5.5 ($7.7) bn, which is directly financed by either the German government or the German Bundesländer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/berlin/article199345/Sarrazin_Keine_neuen_Schulden_mehr_ab_2008.htm|title=Sarrazin: Keine neuen Schulden mehr ab 2008|first=Joachim|last=Fahrun|work=[[Berliner Morgenpost]]|date=10 June 2008|accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainly due to reunification-related expenditures, Berlin as a German state has accumulated more debt than any other city in Germany, with the most current estimate being €60 ($84)bn in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1983556,00.html|title=Debt-Laden Berlin Goes to Court For Federal Aid|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=29 April 2006|accessdate=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Boroughs and localities of Berlin}}
[[File:BerlinDistricts.svg|thumb|right|Map of Berlin's twelve boroughs and their localities.]]

Berlin is subdivided into [[Boroughs and localities of Berlin|twelve boroughs]] (''Bezirke''), but before [[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform]] there were 23. Each borough is subdivided into a number of localities (''Ortsteile''), which represent the traditional [[urbanized]] areas that inhabitants identify with. Some of these have been rearranged several times over the years. At present the city of Berlin consists of 95 such localities. The localities often consist of a number of city neighborhoods (usually called ''[[Kiez]]'' in the [[Berlin dialect]]) representing small residential areas.

Each borough is governed by a Borough Council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five Councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') and a Borough Mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The Borough Council is elected by the Borough Assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). The boroughs of Berlin are not independent municipalities. &lt;!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --&gt; The power of borough governments is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough mayors form the Council of Mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), led by the city's Governing Mayor, which advises the Senate.

The localities have no government bodies of their own, even though most of the localities have historic roots in older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. The subsequent position of locality representative (''Ortsvorsteher'') was discontinued in favor of borough mayors.

===Sister cities===
Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.&lt;ref name=Berlinsistercities&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/staedteverbindungen/index.en.html|title=Berlin's international city relations|work=Berlin Mayor's Office|accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Town twinning between Berlin and other cities began with Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification and later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the West, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.

There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, Conference of the World's Capital Cities. Berlin's official sister cities are:&lt;ref name=Berlinsistercities/&gt;

==Demographics==
{{See also|Berlin population statistics}}
[[File:Berlin Population Development 1880-2007.svg|thumb|Berlin's population 1880–2007.]]

As of September 2009, the city-state of Berlin had a population of 3,439,100 registered inhabitants &lt;ref name=&quot;Population&quot; /&gt; in an area of {{convert|891.82|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;statoffice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-berlin.de/|title=Berlin statistical figures|work=[[Amt für Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg]]|accessdate=19 August 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's population density was 3,848 inhabitants per km² (9,966/sq&amp;nbsp;mi). The [[urban area]] of Berlin stretches beyond the city limits and comprises about 3.7&amp;nbsp;million people while the metropolitan area of the Berlin-Brandenburg region is home to about 4.3&amp;nbsp;million in an area of {{convert|5370|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The [[Larger Urban Zones (LUZ) in the European Union|Larger Urban Zone]] was home to over 4.9 million people in an area of 17,385&amp;nbsp;km² in the year 2004.&lt;ref name=LUZ/&gt;

[[File:800px-PeopleMyfest.jpg|thumb|left|Crowd in [[Kreuzberg]]]]

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, following the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France, the city responded with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin. The act increased the area of Berlin from {{convert|66|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|883|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and the population from 1.9&amp;nbsp;million to 4&amp;nbsp;million.
&lt;br /&gt;
Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin have initiated waves of immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, Berlin is home to about 250,000 [[Turks in Germany|Turks]] (especially in [[Kreuzberg]], [[Neukölln]] and [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], a locality in the [[Boroughs of Berlin|borough]] of [[Berlin-Mitte|Mitte]])&lt;ref name=&quot;250k Turks&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/berlin-shish-and-sauerkraut-to-go-448678.html|title=Berlin: Shish And Sauerkraut To Go|first=Andrew|last=Spooner|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2007-05-13|accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.

In the 1990s the ''Aussiedlergesetze'' made immigration from the former [[Soviet Union]] possible. Today ethnic [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|Germans]] from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russiajournal.com/node/4653 Berlin is speaking Russians' language].

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport in Berlin}}
[[File:BlnHauptbahnhof28.jpg|thumb|[[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]] is the largest crossing station in Europe and has operated since 2006.]]

Berlin has developed a highly complex transportation infrastructure providing very diverse modes of urban mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/01/news/mayor5.php|title=Broke but dynamic, Berlin seeks new identity|work=IHT|accessdate=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 979 bridges cross 197 kilometers of innercity waterways, {{km to mi|5334|precision=0}} of roads run through Berlin, of which {{km to mi|73|precision=0}} are motorways (&quot;[[Autobahn]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot;/&gt; In 2006, 1.416&amp;nbsp;million motor vehicles, were registered in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Statistiken/Verkehr/VerkehrsmittelbestandInfrastruktur/Tabellen/Content75/Fahrzeugbestand,templateId=renderPrint.psml|title=Kraftfahrzeuge und Schienenbestand|work=Destatis|accessdate=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 358 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2008 (570/1000 in Germany), Berlin as a German state and as a major European city has one of the lowest numbers of cars per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2009/0811/berlin/0025/index.html|title=Die Hauptstadt des umweltfreundlichen Verkehrs|work=[[Berliner Zeitung]]|accessdate=11 August 2009|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-distance rail lines connect Berlin with all of the major cities of Germany and with many cities in neighboring European countries. Regional rail lines provide access to the surrounding regions of Brandenburg and to the [[Baltic Sea]]. The [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]] is the largest crossing station in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbf-berlin.de/site/berlin__hauptbahnhof/en/start.html|title=Berlin Hauptbahnhof|work=[[Deutsche Bahn]]|accessdate=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deutsche Bahn]] runs trains to domestic destinations like [[Nuremberg]], [[Hamburg]], [[Freiburg]] and more. It also runs the Airport express, as well as trains to international destinations like [[Moscow]], [[Vienna]], and [[Salzburg]].

Berlin is known for its highly developed bike lane system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/07/bike_city_berli.php|title=Bike City Berlin|work=Treehugger|accessdate=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 710 bicycles per 1000 inhabitants are estimated. Around 500,000 daily riders accounting for 13% of total traffic in 2008. The Senate of Berlin aims to increase the number to 15% of city traffic by the year 2010. Riders have access to {{convert|620|km|abbr=on}} of bike paths including approx. {{convert|150|km|abbr=on}} mandatory bicycle paths, {{convert|190|km|abbr=on}} off-road bicycle routes, {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} of bike lanes on the roads, {{convert|70|km|abbr=on}} of shared bus lanes which are also open to bicyclists, {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} of combined pedestrian/bike paths and {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} of marked bike lanes on the sidewalks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/verkehr/radverkehrsanlagen/en/radwege.shtml|title=Bicycle Routes and Facilities Bicycle Paths|work=Senate Department of urban development|accessdate=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|de|[[Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe]]}} and the Deutsche Bahn manage several dense urban public transport systems.&lt;ref&gt;Amt für Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg, [http://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/produkte/KleineStatistik/kBEst_2008.pdf Die kleine Berlin-Statistik].

[[File:EDDT Empfang &amp; Tower.jpg|thumb|[[Tegel International Airport]]]]

Berlin has two commercial airports. [[Tegel International Airport]] (TXL), the busier, and [[Schönefeld International Airport]] (SXF) handled more than 21 million passengers combined in 2009. Together they serve 166 destinations (123 European) in 50 countries (summer 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notizie.virgilio.it/notizie/economia/2010/3_marzo/24/aeroporti_nel_2011_unico_scalo_a_berlino_da_27_mln_di_2,23530301.html|title=n 2009 nei 3 scali berlinesi sono transitati 21 mln passeggeri|work=notizie.virgilio.it|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tegel lies within the city limits and is the European hub of [[Air Berlin]]. Whereas Schönefeld handles mainly low-cost-aviation and is situated just outside Berlin's south-eastern border in the state of Brandenburg.

Berlin's airport authority aims to transfer all of Berlin's air traffic in November 2011 to a newly built airport at Schönefeld, to be renamed [[Berlin-Brandenburg International Airport|Berlin Brandenburg Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin-airport.de/EN/BBI/|title=Airport Berlin Brandenburg International|work=Airports Berlin|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; City authorities aim to establish a European aviation hub with a gateway to Asia.

===Utilities===
[[File:Berlin HKW Mitte.jpg|thumb|upright|Heizkraftwerk Mitte.]]

Berlin's power supply is mainly provided by the Swedish firm [[Vattenfall]] and relies more heavily than other electricity producers in Germany on [[lignite]] as an energy source. Because burning lignite produces harmful emissions, Vattenfall has announced a commitment to shift towards reliance on cleaner, [[renewable energy]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2006/05/30/a0166|title=Abgase tiefer gelegt|first=Nick|last=Reimer|work=[[Die Tageszeitung|taz]]|date=30 May 2006|accessdate=18 August 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former West Berlin's electricity supply was provided by thermal power stations. To facilitate buffering during load peaks, [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulators]] were installed during the 1980s at some of these power stations. These were connected by static inverters to the power grid and were loaded during times of low power consumption and unloaded during times of high consumption.

In 1993 the power connections to the surrounding areas, which had been capped in 1951, were restored. In the western districts of Berlin, nearly all power lines are underground cables; only a 380&amp;nbsp;kV and a 110&amp;nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380-kV electric line]] was constructed when West Berlin's electrical system was a totally independent system and not connected to those of East or West Germany. This has now become the backbone of the whole city's power system.

Carmaker [[Daimler AG]] and utility RWE AG are going to begin a joint electric car and [[charging station]] test project in Berlin called &quot;E-Mobility Berlin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/apwire/3e8bc7ee811bd771be83c3bf1960bbbc.htm]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health system===
[[File:Charité (Berlin).jpg|thumb|The [[Charité]] main building.]]

Berlin has a long tradition as a city of medicine and medical technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/magazin/wissen/Elitewettbewerb-Universitaeten;art304,2400973|title=Berlin leuchtet|first1=Anja|last1=Kühne|first2=Tilmann|last2=Warnecke|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=18 August 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of medicine has been widely influenced by scientists from Berlin. [[Rudolf Virchow]] was the founder of cellular pathology, while [[Robert Koch]], discovered the vaccinations for anthrax, cholera, and tuberculosis bacillus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charite.de/ch/neuro/lokales/charite/geschichte.html|title=History of the Charité of Berlin|work=[[Charité]]|date=6 September 2005|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Charité]] hospital complex is today the largest [[university hospital]] in Europe tracing back its origins to the year 1710. The Charité is spread over four sites and comprises 3,300 beds, around 14,000 staff, 8,000 students, over 60 operating theatres with an annual turnover of over one billion euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anselleurope.com/medical/index.cfm?Include=testimonials&amp;lang=EN&amp;I=4166|title=Customer company profile|work=Ansell Healthcare|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a joint institution of the [[Free University of Berlin]] and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], including a wide range of institutes and medical competence centers. Among them are the German Heart Center, one of the most renowned transplantation centers, the Max-Delbrück-Center for Molecular Medicine and the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics. Scientific research is complemented by many industry research departments of companies such as Siemens, Schering or debis.

The '''Ford Mustang''' is an [[automobile]] manufactured car by the [[Ford Motor Company]]. It was initially based on the second generation North American [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]], a [[compact car]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iacocca: An Autobiography'', by [[Lee Iacocca]], Chapter VI&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced early on April 17, 1964,&lt;ref&gt;Flory, J. &quot;Kelly&quot;, Jr. ''American Cars 1960–1972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland &amp; Coy, 2004), p.367.&lt;/ref&gt; the 1965 Mustang is the automaker's most successful launch since the [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Model A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Hinckley|first = Jim|last2 = Robinson|first2 = Jon G.|title = The Big Book of Car Culture|publisher = MotorBooks/MBI|year = 2005|page = 175|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=NorSiqCb9mMC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=%22most+successful+introduction%22+automobile&amp;lr=&amp;ei=5kGmSKmLCJjgiQGCqqH6BA&amp;sig=ACfU3U1BMvIzvInczLVKp9fAChwP0wkw3w|isbn = 9780760319659 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Mustang created the &quot;[[pony car]]&quot; class of American automobile — sports car-like [[coupe]]s with long hoods and short rear decks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Mueller|first = Mike|title = Ford Mustang|publisher = MotorBooks/MBI|year = 1997|page = 21|isbn = 9780879389901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; — and gave rise to competitors such as GM's [[Chevrolet Camaro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Young|first = Anthony|title = Camaro|publisher = MotorBooks/MBI|year = 2004 |page = 8|isbn = 9780760319321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; AMC's [[AMC Javelin|Javelin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Dick Teague|journal = Automobile Quarterly, Volume 30 |issue = 2|page = 15|year = 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chrysler's revamped [[Plymouth Barracuda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Zazarine|first = Paul|title = Barracuda and Challenger|publisher = MotorBooks/MBI|year = 2002|page = 29|isbn = 9780879385385}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also inspired coupés such as the [[Toyota Celica]] and [[Ford Capri]], which were exported to America.

==Background==

Production of the 1965 Mustang began in [[Dearborn, Michigan]] on March 9, 1964 and the car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the [[1964 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]]. It is Ford's third oldest nameplate currently in production next to the [[Ford F-Series|F-Series]] pickup truck line (which has undergone major nameplate changes over the years) and the [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] which is still in production in [[Australia]].

Executive stylist Pres Harris, who was a fan of the World War II [[P-51 Mustang]] fighter plane, is believed by many to have suggested the name and designed the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allfordmustangs.com/articles/Ford_Mustang_I_Prototype_Failed_Appeal_to_the_Crowds.shtml &quot;Ford Mustang Prototype Failed to Appeal to the Crowds&quot;, ''All Ford Mustang News'' website, May 03 2008]. Retrieved on August 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fordpr&gt;[http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=18000 “Mustang Racing History”, Ford Corporate Media website]. Retrieved on August 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view was that the Mustang name was first suggested by Robert J. Eggert, Ford Division market research manager. Eggert, a breeder of [[quarterhorses]], received a birthday present from his wife of the book, ''The Mustangs'' by [[J. Frank Dobie]] in 1960. Later, the book’s title gave him the idea of adding the “Mustang” name for Ford’s new concept car. The designer preferred Cougar or [[Turin|Torino]] (and an advertising campaign using the Torino name was actually prepared), while [[Henry Ford II]] wanted T-bird II.&lt;ref&gt;Witzenburg, Gary. &quot;The Name Game&quot;, ''Motor Trend'', 4/84, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; As the person responsible for Ford’s research on potential names, Eggert added “Mustang” to the list to be tested by focus groups; “Mustang,” by a wide margin, ” came out on top under the heading: “Suitability as Name for the Special Car.”&lt;ref&gt;Walter T. Murphy, &quot;Toot Toot: The Life of a PR Man,&quot; (Birmingham, Michigan, Walmur Publishing 1984), page 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Eggert, &quot;Meadowlark Economics: Collected Essays,&quot; (Berkeley, California, North Atlantic Books, 2009), page 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kate Pierce, &quot;Name That Car,&quot; (Automotive, May 26, 1994), page C.&lt;/ref&gt; The name could not be used in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Witzenburg, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; however, because it was owned by [[Krupp]], which had manufactured trucks between 1951 and 1964 with the name Mustang.  Ford refused to buy the name for about $10,000 [[United States dollar|USD]] from [[Krupp]] at the time.  Later, the name was also used by [[Kreidler]], a manufacturer of mopeds, so until December 1978 the Mustang was sold in Germany as the &quot;T-5.&quot;

Mustangs grew larger and heavier with each model year until, in response to the 1971–1973 models, fans of the original 1964 design wrote to Ford urging a return to its size and concept. It has since seen several platform generations and designs. Although some other pony cars have seen a revival, the Mustang is the only original pony car to remain in uninterrupted production over four decades of development and revision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/NEWSROOM/feature_display.cfm?release=24065N Mustang Ready For the Pony Car War &quot;Mustang is the only one of the original pony cars from the 1960s to live on into the 21st century with no interruption in production.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Lee Iacocca]]'s assistant general manager and chief engineer, [[Donald N. Frey]] was the head engineer for the Mustang project—supervising the overall development of the Mustang in a record 18 months&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetech.org/nmot/detail.cfm?ID=8&amp; &quot;Donald N. Frey, lauteate 1990&quot; National Medal of Technology], retrieved on August 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843628,00.html &quot;The Thinker (Detroit Style)&quot; Time magazine, April 21, 1967], retrieved on August 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; — while Iacocca himself championed the project as Ford Division general manager. The Mustang prototype was a two-seat, mid-mounted engine [[roadster]]. This vehicle employed a Taunus (Ford Germany) V4 engine and was very similar in appearance to the much later [[Pontiac Fiero]].

It was claimed that the decision to abandon the two-seat design was in part due to the low sales experienced with the 2-seat 1955 Thunderbird. To broaden market appeal it was later remodeled as a four-seat car (with full space for the front bucket seats, as originally planned, and a rear bench seat with significantly less space than was common at the time). A &quot;Fastback 2+2&quot; model traded the conventional trunkspace for increased interior volume as well as giving exterior lines similar to those of the second series of the Corvette Sting Ray and European sports cars such as the [[Jaguar E-Type]].

The new design was styled under the direction of Project Design Chief [[Joe Oros]] and his team of [[L. David Ash]], Gale Halderman, and John Foster&lt;ref name=&quot;midco&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Having set the design standards for the Mustang,&lt;ref name=&quot;DMN&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title = Fans celebrate Mustang's 40th | newspaper = Dallas Morning News | url = http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/autos/topstories2/041604ccAutosMustangparty.12fe23361.html | date = 2004-04-16 | last = Reeves | first = Scott  | accessdate = 2010-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oros said:

{{cquote|I told the team that I wanted the car to appeal to women, but I wanted men to desire it, too. I wanted a Ferrari-like front end, the motif centered on the front – something heavy-looking like a Maserati, but, please, not a trident – and I wanted air intakes on the side to cool the rear brakes. I said it should be as sporty as possible and look like it was related to European design.&lt;ref name=&quot;DMN&quot; /&gt;}}

Oros added:

{{cquote|I then called a meeting with all the Ford studio designers. We talked about the sporty car for most of that afternoon, setting parameters for what it should look like—and what it should not look like—by making lists on a large pad, a technique I adapted from the management seminar. We taped the lists up all around the studio to keep ourselves on track. We also had photographs of all the previous sporty cars that had been done in the Corporate Advanced studio as a guide to themes or ideas that were tired or not acceptable to management.

Within a week we had hammered out a new design. We cut templates and fitted them to the clay model that had been started. We cut right into it, adding or deleting clay to accommodate our new theme, so it wasn't like starting all over. But we knew Lincoln-Mercury would have two models. And Advanced would have five, some they had previously shown and modified, plus a couple extras. But we would only have one model because Ford studio had a production schedule for a good many facelifts and other projects. We couldn't afford the manpower, but we made up for lost time by working around the clock so our model would be ready for the management review.&lt;ref name=&quot;midco&quot; /&gt;}}

Favorable [[publicity]] articles appeared in 2,600 newspapers the next morning, the day the car was &quot;officially&quot; revealed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1965-1966-ford-mustang.htm &quot;1965 1966 Ford Mustang,&quot; by the Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'', February 4, 2007], retrieved on August 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=18037 Innovative Marketing and PR Helped Build the Mustang Legend by Ford Motor Company Media, undated], retrieved on August 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A Mustang also appeared in the James Bond film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' in September 1964, the first time the car was used in a movie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/collecting_nikko_goldfinger.php3 &quot;Carrera Goldfinger Racing Set Review&quot; ''MI6'', August 26, 2005], retrieved on August 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

To cut down the development cost and achieve a [[suggested retail price]] of [[United States dollar|US$]]2,368, the Mustang was based heavily on familiar yet simple components, many of which were already in production for other Ford models. Many (if not most) of the interior, [[chassis]], [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and drivetrain components were derived from the [[Ford Falcon (North American)|Ford Falcon]] and [[Ford Fairlane (North American)]]. This use of common components also shortened the learning curve for assembly and repair workers, while at the same time allowing dealers to pick up the Mustang without also have to spend massive amounts of money on spare parts inventories to support the new car line.

Original sales forecasts projected less than 100,000 units for the first year.&lt;ref name=&quot;google30&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Mueller|first = Mike|title = Mustang 1964½-1973|publisher = MotorBooks/MBI|year = 2000|page = 30|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=12Unsmyljk4C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Mustang+sales+first+year&amp;lr=&amp;ei=n0amSP7XFpD0jgHx87D7BA&amp;sig=ACfU3U1s9XLMW2tPSCsGGnYWetWWmFNYfg#PPA30,M1|isbn = 9780760307342 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mark was surpassed in three months from rollout.&lt;ref&gt;Flory, pp. 367–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Another 318,000 would be sold during the model year (a record),&lt;ref&gt;Flory, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; and in its first eighteen months, more than one million Mustangs were built.&lt;ref name=&quot;google30&quot; /&gt; All of these were [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]]-identified as 1965 models, but several changes were made at the traditional opening of the new model year (beginning August 1964), including the addition of back-up lights on some models, the introduction of [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|alternators]] to replace [[Electrical generator#Vehicle-mounted generators|generator]]s, and an upgrade of the V8 engine from {{convert|260|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|289|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[engine displacement|displacement]]. In the case of at least some six-cylinder Mustangs fitted with the {{convert|101|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|170|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} Falcon engine, the rush into production included some unusual quirks, such as a horn ring bearing the 'Ford Falcon' logo beneath a trim ring emblazoned with 'Ford Mustang.' These characteristics made enough difference to warrant designation of the 121,538 earlier ones as &quot;1964½&quot; model-year Mustangs, a distinction that has endured with purists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2009/04/16/457244.html |title=The Great Mustang Debate: 1964 or 1965 |publisher=Theautochannel.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

All of the features added to the &quot;1965&quot; model were available as options or developmental modification to the &quot;1964½&quot; model, which in some cases led to &quot;mix-and-match&quot; confusion as surprised Ford exec hurriedly ramped up production by taking over lines originally intended for other car models' 1965 years. Some cars with 289 engines which were not given the chrome fender badges denoting the larger engine, and more than one car left the plant with cutouts for back-up lights but no lights nor the later wiring harness needed to operate them. While these would today be additional-value collectors' items, most of these oddities were corrected at the dealer level, sometimes only after they had been noticed by buyers.

[[Image:Ford Mustang II.jpg|thumb|1974–1978 Mustang II.]]

The 1970s brought about more stringent pollution laws and the [[1973 OPEC oil embargo]]. As a result, large, fuel-inefficient cars fell into disfavor, and the Pony Cars were no exception. [[Lee Iacocca]], who became president of the Ford Motor Company in 1964 and was the driving force behind the original Mustang, ordered a smaller, more fuel-efficient Mustang for 1974. Initially it was to be based on the [[Ford Maverick (Car)|Ford Maverick]], but ultimately was based on the [[Ford Pinto]] subcompact.

The new model (dubbed and badged &quot;Mustang II&quot;) was introduced two months before the first &quot;Energy Crisis&quot; in [[1973 oil crisis|October 1973]], and its reduced size allowed it to compete more effectively against smaller imported sports coupés such as the Japanese [[Toyota Celica]] and the European [[Ford Capri]] (then Ford-built in Germany and Britain, sold in U.S. by Mercury as a [[captive import]] car). First-year sales were 385,993 cars, compared with the original Mustang's twelve-month sales record of 418,812.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1974-1975-1976-1977-1978-ford-mustang.htm &quot;1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978 Ford Mustang Overview&quot; by the Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'', undated], retrieved on March 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance was reduced, and despite the car's new handling and engineering features the galloping mustang emblem &quot;became a less muscular steed that seemed to be [[canter]]ing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1974-1975-1976-1977-1978-ford-mustang5.htm &quot;1974 Ford Mustang Engines and Options&quot; 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 Ford Mustang by the Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'', February 15, 2007], retrieved on August 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The car was available in coupé and [[hatchback]] versions. Changes introduced in 1975 included reinstatement of the 302 [[Cubic inch|CID]] [[V8]] option (called the &quot;5.0&amp;nbsp;L&quot; although its capacity was 4.94&amp;nbsp;L) and availability of an economy option called the &quot;MPG Stallion&quot;. Other changes in appearance and performance came with a &quot;Cobra II&quot; version in 1976 and a &quot;King Cobra&quot; in 1978.

== Third generation (1979–1993) ==
{{main|Ford Mustang (third generation)}}
[[Image:'87-'88 Ford Mustang 5.0.jpg|thumb|1985–1986 Ford Mustang GT]]

The 1979 Mustang was based on the larger [[Ford Fox platform|Fox platform]] (initially developed for the 1978 [[Ford Fairmont]] and [[Mercury Zephyr]]). The interior was restyled to accommodate four people in comfort despite a smaller rear seat. The [[trunk (automobile)|trunk]] was larger, as was the engine bay, for easier service access.

Body styles included a [[coupé]], ([[notchback]]), and [[hatchback]]; a convertible was offered in 1983. Available trim levels included L, GL, GLX, LX, GT, Turbo GT, SVO (1984–86), Cobra, and Cobra R (1993).

In response to slumping sales and escalating fuel prices during the early 1980s, a [[Third-generation Ford Mustang#Proposed replacement|new Mustang]] was in development. It was to be a variant of the [[Mazda MX-6]] assembled at [[AutoAlliance International]] in [[Flat Rock, Michigan]]. Enthusiasts wrote to Ford objecting to the proposed change to a front-wheel drive, Japanese-designed Mustang without a V8 option. The result was a major facelift of the [[Third-generation Ford Mustang#1987–1993|existing Mustang]] in 1987, while the MX-6 variant became the 1989 [[Ford Probe]].

*1979 served as an [[Indianapolis 500 pace cars|Indianapolis 500 pace car]] and Ford built 10,478 commemorative replicas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Sessler|first = Peter C.|last2 = Sessler|first2 = Nilda|title = Ford Mustang Buyer's And Restoration Guide|publisher = Sams Technical Publishing|year = 2006|page = 126|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=l_1ngoGACCUC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=1979+Mustang+Indianapolis+500+Pace+Car&amp;ei=HAidS6G9Io3mygTt7ZW5Cg&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=1979%20Mustang%20Indianapolis%20500%20Pace%20Car&amp;f=false|isbn = 9780790613260|accessdate = 2010-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2002FordMustang.jpg|thumb|2002 Ford Mustang Convertible]]

In 1994 the Mustang underwent its first major redesign in fifteen years. Code named &quot;SN-95&quot; by [[Ford]], it was based on an updated version of the [[rear-wheel drive]] Fox platform called &quot;Fox-4.&quot; The new styling by [[Patrick Schiavone]] incorporated several styling cues from earlier Mustangs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1994-1995-1996-1997-1998-ford-mustang.htm &quot;1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 Ford Mustang Overview&quot; by the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide, 2007-02-23], retrieved on 2010-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time since 1973, a [[hatchback]] coupe model was unavailable.

The base model came with a [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|3.8 OHV]] [[V6 engine|V6]] (232&amp;nbsp;cid) engine rated at {{convert|145|bhp|abbr=on}} in 1994 and 1995, or {{convert|150|bhp|abbr=on}} (1996–1998), and was mated to a standard 5-speed [[manual transmission]] or optional 4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]. Though initially used in the 1994 and 1995 Mustang GT, Ford retired the 302&amp;nbsp;cid pushrod small-block V8 after nearly 40 years of use, replacing it with the newer [[Ford Modular engine|Modular]] 4.6&amp;nbsp;L (281&amp;nbsp;cid) SOHC V8 in the 1996 Mustang GT. The 4.6&amp;nbsp;L V8 was initially rated at {{convert|215|bhp|abbr=on}}, 1996–1997, but was later increased to {{convert|225|bhp|abbr=on}} in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1994-1995-1996-1997-1998-ford-mustang8.htm &quot;The 1996 Ford Mustang&quot; by the Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'', 2007-02-23], retrieved on 2010-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For 1999, the Mustang received Ford's [[New Edge]] styling theme with sharper contours, larger wheel arches, and creases in its bodywork, but its basic proportions, interior design, and chassis remained the same as the previous model. The Mustang's powertrains were carried over for 1999, but benefitted from new improvements.

The base model is powered by a {{Convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} cast-iron block [[Ford Cologne V6 engine|4.0 L SOHC V6]], which replaces the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L pushrod V6 used previously. The Mustang GT features an aluminum block 4.6&amp;nbsp;L SOHC [[multi-valve|3-valve]] [[Ford Modular engine#4.6.C2.A0L|Modular]] V8 with [[Variable Cam Timing|variable camshaft timing]] (VCT) that produces {{Convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The 2005 Mustang GT has an approximate weight to power ratio of {{convert|11.5|lb|abbr=on}}/bhp. The base Mustang comes with a standard [[Borg-Warner T-5 transmission|Tremec T-5]] 5-speed manual transmission while Ford's own [[Ford Bordeaux Automatic Transmissions|5R55S]] 5-speed automatic, a Mustang first, is optional. Though the Mustang GT features the same automatic transmission as the V6 model, the Tremec T-5 manual is substituted with the heavier duty [[Tremec TR-3650 transmission|Tremec TR-3650]] 5-speed manual transmission to better handle the GT's extra power.&lt;ref&gt;Ford Motor Company. [http://media.ford.com/products/presskit_display.cfm?vehicle_id=1052&amp;press_section_id=398&amp;make_id=92''2005 Mustang'']. Ford Media. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford announced in July 2007 that all 2008 Mustangs would have seats containing material derived from [[soybean]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =New Twist on Green: 2008 Ford Mustang Seats Will Be Soy-Based Foam|publisher =Edmunds inside line|date=July 12, 2007|url =http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=121682| accessdate =2007-10-02}}{{dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; harking back to some of [[Henry Ford#Sidelights|Henry Ford's]] ideals.

A new option for the 2009 Mustang was the glass roof. This $1,995 option is in effect a full roof sunroof that splits the difference in price and purpose of the coupe and convertible models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.windingroad.com/body-stylesmarket-segment/sportsgts/ford-shows-2009-glass-roof-mustang/ &quot;Ford Shows 2009 Glass Roof Mustang&quot;], Winding Road.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010 ===
For the 2010 models, Ford unveiled a redesigned Mustang prior to the [[LA Auto Show|Los Angeles International Auto Show]]. The 2010 Mustang remains on the [[Ford D2C platform|D2C]] platform and mostly retains the previous-year's drivetrain options. The Mustang received a thoroughly revised exterior, with only the roof panel being retained, that is sculpted for a leaner, more muscular appearance and better aerodynamic performance ([[drag coefficient|coefficient of drag]] has been reduced by 4% on V6 models and 7% on GT models &lt;ref name=&quot;suspension&quot;&gt;Ford Motor Company.[http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1982&amp;item_id=5604&amp;press_section_id=2859 &quot;2010 Mustang Steering and Suspension&quot;]. Ford Media. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The V6 for base Mustangs remains unchanged, while the Mustang GT's [[Ford Modular engine|4.6&amp;nbsp;L V8]] has been revised to specifications similar to that of the 2008–2009 Mustang Bullitt's 4.6&amp;nbsp;L V8, resulting in {{convert|315|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 6000&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{convert|325|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque at 4250&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref name=&quot;techspecs&quot;&gt;Ford Motor Company. [http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1982&amp;item_id=5605&amp;press_section_id=2878 &quot;2010 Mustang Technical Specifications&quot;]. Ford Media. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other mechanical features for the 2010 Mustang include new spring rates and dampers to improve ride quality and control, standard traction control system and stability control system on all models, and new wheel sizes. For the Mustang GT, two performance packages were made available. Other new features and options for the 2010 Mustang include [[Ford Sync|Ford SYNC]], dual-zone automatic climate control, an updated navigation system with [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] Travel Link, a capless fuel filler, and a reverse camera system to aid in backing up. The SYNC, navigation, and the reverse camera are not available on the basic V6 coupe.

[[File:2010 Ford Mustang -- 07-18-2009.jpg|thumb|right||2010 Ford Mustang V6 coupe]]
The 2010 model year Mustang was released in the spring of 2009. Ten models were available for the 2010 Mustang, with base prices ranging from $21,395 for the basic V6 to $51,725 for the GT500 Convertible.

=== 2011 ===
Ford revised all the Mustang's engines for 2011. The new V6 is a smaller 3.7&amp;nbsp;L (227 cu. in.) aluminum block engine weighing {{convert|40|lb|abbr=on}} lighter than the outgoing version. The engine produces {{convert|305|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque. Ford announced on December 28, 2009 that the 2011 Mustang GT would feature a 5.0 liter (302 cu. in.) engine displacement that will produce 412 horsepower and 390 ft/lbs of torque on &quot;premium fuel&quot; (gasoline with a [[Octane rating#Anti-Knock_Index_.28AKI.29|pump octane]] rating of 93); on &quot;regular fuel&quot; (gasoline with a pump octane rating of 87), these numbers fall to {{convert|402|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|377|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011techspecs&quot;&gt;Ford Motor Company. [http://www.fordvehicles.com/cars/mustang/specifications/engine/ &quot;2011 Ford Mustang Full Engine Specifications&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; The power and performance that the 2011 Mustang GT puts out is largely due to the new Ford 5.0-liter V8 “Coyote” engine. The Coyote is a 32 valve (4 valves per cylinder) with Twin Independent Variable Cam Timing (TiVCT). These cams will control intake and exhaust functions of the vehicle which will maximize combustion and ultimately power. The transmission can be bought in a 6 speed automatic or manual (up from the previous 5 speed transmission). The innovative Electronic Power Assist Steering (EPAS) removes the conventional hydraulic power steering pump. The system does not use belts previously required for steering, thus drive train horsepower loss is decreased.  An optional [[Brembo]] brake upgrade is available. These brakes essentially come from the Shelby GT-500 and this the first time they will be offered on the Mustang. In addition to the upgraded brake package, Ford will throw in a pair of 19” wheels and performance tires.&lt;ref&gt;http://jautosource.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Shelby GT500's 5.4L block is now made out of aluminum, instead of iron as in previous years, and is now rated at {{convert|550|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|510|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque. Due to being made of aluminum instead of iron, the new block is {{convert|102|lb|abbr=on}} lighter than the old one, which helps to improve fuel economy, acceleration, handling, and steering precision.&lt;ref&gt;Auto Fans.

==Racing==
{{Refimprovesection|date=April 2008}}

The Mustang made its first public appearance on a racetrack little more than a month after its April 17 introduction, as [[pace car]] for the [[1964 Indianapolis 500]].&lt;ref name=fordpr/&gt;

The same year, Mustangs achieved the first of many notable competition successes, winning first and second in class in the [[Tour de France]] international rally. The car’s American competition debut, also in 1964, was in [[drag racing]], where private individuals and dealer-sponsored teams campaigned Mustangs powered by 427 cu. in. V8s.

In late 1964, Ford contracted [[Holman &amp; Moody]] to prepare ten 427-powered Mustangs to contest the [[National Hot Rod Association]]'s (NHRA) A/Factory Experimental class in the 1965 drag racing season. Five of these special Mustangs made their competition debut at the 1965 NHRA Winternationals, where they qualified in the Factory Stock Eliminator class. The car driven by Bill Lawton won the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartechbooks.com/vstore/showdetl.cfm?st=0&amp;st2=0&amp;st3=0&amp;CATID=21&amp;Product_ID=2553&amp;DID=6 Morris, Charlie. &quot;Ford's 1965 Factory Experimental Mustangs&quot;, ''Car Tech Inc.'' website, undated article]. Retrieved on August 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade later Bob Glidden won the Mustang’s first NHRA Pro Stock title.

Early Mustangs also proved successful in road racing. The GT 350 R, the race version of the [[Shelby Mustang|Shelby GT 350]], won five of the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s (SCCA) six divisions in 1965. Drivers were Jerry Titus, Bob Johnson and [[Mark Donohue]], and Titus won the (SCCA) B-Production national championship. GT 350s won the B-Production title again in 1966 and 1967. They also won the 1966 manufacturers’ championship in the inaugural SCCA [[Trans-Am series]], and repeated the win the following year.&lt;ref name=fordpr/&gt;

In 1969, modified versions of the 428 Mach 1, Boss 429 and Boss 302 took 295 United States Auto Club-certified records at [[Bonneville Salt Flats]]. The outing included a 24-hour run on a {{convert|10|mi|km|sing=on}} course at an average speed of {{convert|157|mi/h|km/h}}. Drivers were [[Mickey Thompson]], [[Danny Ongais]], Ray Brock and Bob Ottum.&lt;ref name=fordpr/&gt;

Boss 429 engines powered [[Ford Torino]]s in 1969 and 1970 [[NASCAR]] racing.

In 1970 the Mustang won the manufacturers’ championship in the Trans-Am series once again, with [[Parnelli Jones]] and [[George Follmer]] driving. Jones won the drivers’ title. Two years later [[Dick Trickle]] won 67 short-track feature races, a national record for wins in a single season.

In 1975 Ron Smaldone's Mustang became the first-ever American car to win the Showroom Stock national championship in SCCA road racing.

Mustangs also competed in the [[IMSA]] GTO class, with wins in 1984 and 1985. In 1985 John Jones also won the 1985 GTO drivers’ championship; Wally Dallenbach Jr., John Jones and [[Doc Bundy]] won the GTO class at the [[Daytona 24 Hours]]; and Ford won its first manufacturers’ championship in road racing since 1970. Three class wins went to Lynn St. James, the first woman to win in the series.

1986 brought eight more GTO wins and another manufacturers’ title. [[Scott Pruett]] won the drivers’ championship. The GT Endurance Championship also went to Ford.

In drag racing Rickie Smith’s [[Motorcraft]] Mustang won the [[International Hot Rod Association]] [[Pro Stock]] world championship.

In 1987 Saleen Autosport Mustangs driven by [[Steve Saleen]] and [[Rick Titus]] won the SCCA Escort Endurance SSGT championship, and in [[International Motor Sports Association]] (IMSA) racing a Mustang again won the GTO class in the Daytona 24 hours. In 1989, its silver anniversary year, the Mustang won Ford its first Trans-Am manufacturers’ title since 1970, with Lynn St. James winning the drivers’ championship. In 1997, [[Tommy Kendall]]’s Roush-prepared Mustang won a record 11 consecutive races in Trans-Am to secure his third straight driver’s championship.

In 2002 John Force broke his own NHRA drag racing record by winning his 12th national championship in his Ford Mustang [[Funny Car]], Force beat that record again in 2006, becoming the first ever 14-time champion, again, driving a Mustang.&lt;ref name=fordpr/&gt;

Currently Mustangs compete in several racing series, including the [[Mustang Challenge for the Miller Cup]] and the [[KONI Challenge Series|KONI Challenge]], where it won the manufacturer's title in 2005 &amp; 2008, and the[[Canada Drift]], [[Formula Drift]] and [[D1 Grand Prix]] series. They are highly competitive in the SCCA [[Speed World Challenge]] GT Series.

As reported by Jayski.com, the Ford Mustang will be Ford's [[Car of Tomorrow]] for the NASCAR Nationwide Series in 2010, opening a new chapter in both Mustang's history and Ford's history.

== Awards ==
[[Image:2005 mustang car of the year award.JPG|thumb|2005 Canadian Car of the Year]]
The 1965 Mustang won the Tiffany Gold Medal for excellence in American design, the first automobile ever to do so.

The Mustang was on the [[Car and Driver Ten Best]] list in [[Car and Driver Ten Best#1983|1983]], [[Car and Driver Ten Best#1987|1987]], [[Car and Driver Ten Best#1988|1988]], [[Car and Driver Ten Best#2005|2005]], and [[Car and Driver Ten Best#2006|2006]]. It won the [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]] award in 1974 and 1994.

In 2005 it was runner-up to the [[Chrysler 300]] for the [[North American Car of the Year]] award and was named [[Canadian Car of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=19987 Ford Motor Company - Featured Story - Ford Mustang is Named 2005 Canadian Car of the Year&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lamborghini Gallardo''' ({{IPA-it|ɡaˈʎarðo}}{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}) is a [[sports car]] built by [[Lamborghini]]. The Gallardo is Lamborghini's most-produced model to date, with over 5000 built in its first three years of production.&lt;ref name=&quot;gallardo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lambocars.com/new/5000.htm | title=Automobili Lamborghini starts the year with production record of five thousandth Gallardo | work=lambocars.com | date=January 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each car costs about $180,000 to $210,000.
The car is named after a famous breed of fighting bull. The [[Italian (language)|Spanish]] word ''gallardo'' translates into &quot;gallant,&quot; and from Italian into &quot;striking&quot;.

The Gallardo offers two choices of transmissions, a conventional (H-Box) six-speed [[manual transmission]], and an advanced six-speed electro-hydraulically controlled [[Semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic]] [[electrohydraulic manual transmission|robotized manual]], which Lamborghini abbreviates to &quot;E-gear&quot;. The &quot;E-gear&quot; allows the driver to make shifts much faster than a manual transmission would. The driver shifts up and down via paddles behind the steering wheel, and does not and cannot manually actuate the [[clutch]].

For the MY2006 (launched in late 2005) Lamborghini introduced many changes to the car to counter some criticisms garnered by the press and owners. These were derived from the limited edition Gallardo SE. The exhaust system was changed to a more sporty one (including a flap to make it quieter around town), the suspension was revised and a new steering rack was fitted, the engine power was increased by 20&amp;nbsp;bhp to a maximum of {{convert|512|bhp|kW|0|lk=on}}, the biggest change was an overall lowering of the gearing especially in 1st to 5th. The result was a much improved car, it handled and turned in better, sounded better under full throttle and the extra power and lower gearing turned an already fast car into a seriously quick one.

The [[Audi R8 (road car)|Audi R8]] sports car, launched in early 2007, is based on the Gallardo [[automobile platform|platform]], and uses a 4.2 litre [[V8]] in place of the Gallardo's V10 to avoid competing directly with the Gallardo. In December 2008, Audi unveiled a V10 Audi R8, with a detuned version of the Gallardo's, placed between the R8 V8 and the Gallardo.

For the 2008 model year, features added to the Gallardo included an onboard computer, [[iPod]] connectivity with USB, heated mirrors, Q-citura stitching that originally could only be found on the Nera model, and a beige soft-top on the Spyder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2007/08/14/lamborghini-releases-2008-model-year-changes/ AutoBlog.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Lamborghini releases 2008 model year changes&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==
===Lamborghini Concept S (2005)===
{{Main|Lamborghini Concept S}}
It is a concept vehicle based on contemporary Gallardo, but without roof. The car was designed by [[Luc Donckerwolke]], Head of Lamborghini Design.

The car was unveiled in 2004 Geneva Motor Show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/2219/Lamborghini-Concept-S.html UltimateCarpage.com], Lamborghini Concept S&lt;/ref&gt;

===SE (2005)===
[[Image:CIMG8207 (Medium) (2).JPG|thumb|right|2006 Verde Ithaca Gallardo SE on Angeles Crest Hwy in Los Angeles.]]
Gallardo SE (Special Edition) is a limited (250 unit) version introduced in late 2005. The SE is distinguished from the regular Gallardo externally by having a black-roofed two-tone color scheme as well as specially-designed &quot;Callisto&quot; rims shod with [[Pirelli]] tires. Note that the Gallardo SE could only be ordered in a very small selection of exterior colors: two grey shades as well as white (Balloon white), yellow (Giallo Midas), Orange (Arancio Borealis) and green (Verde Ithaca)

[[Image:IMG 7110 -1(Small).JPG|thumb|left|2006 Verde Ithaca Gallardo SE Interior.]]
The Gallardo SE comes with a two-tone interior. All piping and stitching on the ultra-quality leather are executed in the same color as the bodywork of the car. The mid sections of the seats are finished in color-coded upholstery and even the black floormats have a color coded borders.

A rear-view camera is also standard issue on the Gallardo SE, as is a multimedia system and a navigation system. The sport suspension and an exclusive cover also came with the car but there are still several other options available, like the E-gear, which featured a 'thrust' mode to offer even more impressive acceleration by improving the gearchange through the different gears.

This &quot;thrust&quot; mode automatically revs the car to 5,000 rpm, drops the [[clutch]] engaging all four wheels in a controlled [[burnout]], and ensures the car performs maximum acceleration. This &quot;launch&quot; only requires the driver to engage the &quot;thrust&quot; mode and step on the gas pedal, similar to the launch technology in pre-2008 Formula 1 race cars.

===Nera (2006)===
[[Image:LamborghiniGallardoNero2.JPG|thumb|Lamborghini Gallardo Nera]]
Gallardo Nera (Special Edition) is a limited (185 unit) version of contemporary Gallardo coupe introduced at the [[Mondial de l'Automobile 2006|Paris Motor Show]]. The car was designed to showcase the customization options available to the customer in the Ad Personam program.

The Nera features special matte black body panels, and is only available in black—actually a combination of Nero Serapis and Nero Noctis. Brake calipers are painted a special silver, and the taillights are smoked to match the darker paint scheme. The interior is stitched from high-contrast black and white [[leather]] in the Q-Citura (lozenge shaped) fashion. Note that the glass engine cover remained an option, even on the Nera.

Among the produced Gallardo Nera, 60 were destined for the American market, 91 were sold in Europe.

===Gallardo Spyder (2006-2007)===
[[Image:White Lambo Gallardo Spyder on display.jpg|thumb|left|Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder]]
The production [[spyder]] model of the Gallardo was unveiled at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in January 2006.  It is considered by the company to be an entirely new model, with {{convert|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and a lower-ratio six-speed [[manual transmission]].  The soft top is fully [[convertible|retractable]].

[[Aerosmith]] [[drummer]] [[Joey Kramer]] was the first person in North America to take delivery of the Gallardo Spyder.

''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]] announced on 18 February 2007 that he had bought a Gallardo Spyder, replacing his [[Ford GT]].

===Racing (2007-)===
In 2007, a Lamborghini Gallardo was entered in FIA GT3, as well as the Japanese '[[SUPER GT]]' Championship in the GT300 class, the lower of the two classes in the series.

The FIA GT3 car was built with help from German motorsport specialists Reiter Engineering, who previously made the Murcielago GT1 and the Diablo GTR Super Trophy racers. All the extra aerodynamics were bolt-on parts, conforming with cost-effective regulations that meant the finished car had to closely resemble its road-going counterpart. Brembo racing brakes and OZ Racing wheels were also added. It remained All-Wheel-Drive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supercars.net/cars/3475.html SuperCars.net]&lt;/ref&gt; It produced {{convert|512|bhp|kW|0|lk=on}} @ 7800rpm and 376.2&amp;nbsp;lb.ft of Torque @ 4500 rpm, barely more than the road car, and only as a result of adding an unsilenced racing exhaust system and better cooling.

The SUPER GT car had to conform to rather different regulations. It could produce no more than 300PS (295&amp;nbsp;bhp/224&amp;nbsp;kW) and must be Rear-Wheel-Drive. The power is limited by air restrictors placed in the engine bay. The gearbox is a sequential 6-Speed twin-clutch setup. The rules regarding aerodynamics are far looser than those in FIA GT, meaning the SUPER GT car has more advanced aero, including a much bigger rear wing. It took a while to be competitive, only being consistently at the top this 2009 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supergt.net/en/ SuperGT.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LP560-4 Super Trofeo (2009-)'''

Lamborghini introduced what it calls the 'Fastest one-make series in the world', featuring a 570&amp;nbsp;bhp, All-Wheel-Drive race-prepared version of the newer Gallardo LP560-4. The series suppourted European race series such as Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM), FIA GT Series and the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC), featuring 18 races overall and having a 30-car grid consisting of privateer teams as well as Lamborghini dealer teams and one factory team featuring guest drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netcarshow.com/lamborghini/2009-gallardo_lp560-4_super_trofeo/ NetCarShow.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superleggera (2007-2008)===
[[Image:Gallardosuperleggera.jpg|thumb|left|Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera.]]
A version of the Gallardo, dubbed the ''Superleggera'' (super light), was launched at the 2007 [[Geneva Auto Show]] supposedly in preparation for the next [[Ferrari F430#430 Scuderia|Ferrari 430 Scuderia]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The Superleggera paid tribute to the first Lamborghini production model, the famous 350GT, which was designed and built by the Carrozzeria Touring in Milan, a coachbuilding company that recently restarted its activities. The Lamborghini Gallardo doesn't have a Superleggera style constructed body, only the name.&lt;ref name=&quot;channel4.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/4car/di/road+test/driving+impression/8154/1|title=Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera (2007-)|accessdate=2009-03-14|work=channel4.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine's improved intake, exhaust and ECU added {{convert|10|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} for a total of {{convert|530|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The 6-speed e-gear transmission, usually a US$ 10,000 option, now comes as a standard.

The Superleggera is lighter than the base Gallardo by {{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} ({{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in US model) from {{convert|1430|kg|lb|abbr=on}} via the use of carbon fibre panels for the rear diffuser, undertray, the rearview-mirror housings, the interior door panels, the central tunnel, engine cover; titanium wheel nuts, carbon fibre sports seats with Alcantara.

Colour choices include Midas Yellow, Borealis Orange, Telesto Gray and Noctis Black.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2007/02/26/lamborghini-gallardo-superleggera-revealed/ AutoBlog.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The vehicle was unveiled in 2007 [[Geneva Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2007/03/07/geneva-motor-show-lamborghini-gallardo-superleggera/ AutoBlog.com], Geneva Motor Show: Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera&lt;/ref&gt;

The full price for a Superleggera with everything on it runs for over $200,000. Lamborghini began offering the Gallardo Superleggera in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.com/autoshows/12572/2007-lamborghini-gallardo-superleggera.html Car &amp; Driver: 2007 Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera - Auto Shows]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2008, Lamborghini announced that they had ceased production of the Gallardo Superleggera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2008/03/27/lamborghini-ceases-production-of-gallardo-superleggera Lamborghini ceases production of Gallardo Superleggera - Autoblog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During its production life, 172 were produced, with 10 in white, 34 in grey, 37 in black, 45 in yellow and 46 in orange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/superleggera-dead TopGear.com], Silence of the Lambs&lt;/ref&gt;

===LP 560-4 (2008-)===
[[Image:Lamborghini Gallardo LP560 - 1.jpg|thumb|right|Lamborghini Gallardo LP 560-4]]
It is powered by a new 5.2L V10 with [[gasoline direct injection|direct injection]], with improved power and torque. Unlike the precedent engine, this engine no longer has [[split crankpins]], so it is not even firing, but Lamborghini says that due to the stiffer [[crankshaft]] it has less vibrations than the previous engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evo.co.uk/news/evonews/218484/lamborghini_gallardo_lp5604.html EVO.co.uk &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Lamborghini Gallardo LP 560-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmission choices include six-speed manual or a six-speed E-gear, with E-gear revised to change gears by a rotational selector instead of a fore/aft movement, which offers 40% quicker shifts. E-gear also added Corsa setting and Thrust Mode launch control system.

The car was also {{convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=on}} lighter than 2008 base Gallardo. Other changes include a new front bumper influenced by the Murcielago and exterior lights influenced by the [[Lamborghini Reventón]].

Gallardo LP 560-4 has base price of US$201,000, but can go over $222,000 with e-gear, carbon ceramic brakes, navigation and other options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2008/05/22/how-much-will-that-new-lamborghini-actually-cost-you/ AutoBlog.com], How much will that new Lamborghini actually cost you?&lt;/ref&gt; Other factory options are available with Ad Personam program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/01/11/detroit-2009-lamborghini-ups-the-personalization-options/ AutoBlog.com], Detroit 2009: Lamborghini ups the personalization options&lt;/ref&gt; The British version has MSRP of £147,330.00 ($235,730 USD), including NavTrak vehicle tracking system and delivery package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2008/06/06/lamborghini-prices-gallardo-lp560-4-for-uk-releases-new-pics/ AutoBlog.com], Lamborghini prices Gallardo LP560-4 for UK, releases new pics&lt;/ref&gt;

In an episode of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', the LP 560-4 managed a lap of 1:19.5, faster than the [[Ferrari F430]] Scuderia.

The first production LP560-4 was built with help of an ''[[Automobile Magazine]]'' journalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automobilemag.com/auto_shows/2008_geneva/0803_2009_lamborghini_gallardo_lp560-4/index.html AutomobileMag.com], Auto Shows: 2009 Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The first US car was sold in 16th Annual Race to Erase MS charity auction for $270,000 to former True Religion Jeans co-founder/co-creator Kymberly Gold and music producer Victor Newman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/05/11/first-us-bound-lamborghini-gallardo-lp560-4-spyder-raises-270k/ AutoBlog.com], First US-bound Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4 Spyder raises $270k at charity auction&lt;/ref&gt;

The drop-top limiting this version's top speed to around 200&amp;nbsp;mph.

===Super Trofeo (2009)===
[[File:Lamborghini Super Trofeo 99 2010 amk.JPG|thumb|Lamborghini Super Trofeo]]
It is a limited (30 units) version designed for Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo one-make racing series. The series began in May 2009.

The Super Trofeo race car is based on the Gallardo LP 560-4 sports car, but with a reworked chassis and a direct injection V10 engine rated {{convert|570|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} with higher compression ratio of 12.5:1, variable valve timing. The car has dry weight of {{convert|1300|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. E-gear transmission is standard.
 
The Super Trofeo car and parts package cost €200,000 (US$284,300) plus tax, available via Lamborghini dealerships, with support and parts sales trackside.

The car set the fastest lap time at the [[Vallelunga Circuit]], with [[Giorgio Sanna]] as driver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2008/11/26/lamborghini-super-trofeo-hits-the-racetrack-for-first-test/ AutoBlog.com], Lamborghini Super Trofeo hits the racetrack for first test&lt;/ref&gt;

===LP 550-2 Valentino Balboni (2009)===
It is a limited (250 units) version named after Lamborghini test driver [[Valentino Balboni]]. The engine was rated at {{convert|550|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The vehicle had dry weight of {{convert|1380|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Unlike the contemporary line-up, this model is [[rear wheel drive]] (because the standard [[all-wheel drive]] system was removed).

The CORSA ESP setting allows greater drift angles over regular models. 

Other features include re-calibrated optional e-gear transmission, redeveloped 45% limited slip differential, full leather black upholstery with white colour strips, Polar white centre console, a stripe down the centre of the car, and a badge below the left side window bears the signature of Valentino Balboni and the production number of the car.

The Lamborghini LP 550-2 Valentino Balboni can reach a top speed of 199&amp;nbsp;mph and reach 0–100&amp;nbsp;km/h in 3.9 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/06/30/lamborghini-gallardo-lp550-2|title=Lamborghini LP550-2 - the First RWD Lambo in 10 Years|publisher=Automoblog.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vehicle has MSRP of €162000 (Europe), £137900 (UK), $219800 (US).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/06/30/officially-official-lamborghini-gallardo-lp-550-2-valentino-bal/ AutoBlog.com], Official: Lamborghini Gallardo LP 550-2 Valentino Balboni&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the car was voted ''[[Top Gear]]''{{'}}s car of the year; Richard Hammond explained: &quot;We were impressed with its stripe, its V10 engine, its rear wheel drive, the savagery of its exhaust, and its, er, stripe.&quot;

===LP 570-4 Superleggera===
[[File:Lamborghini Gallardo LP570-4 Superleggera.jpg|thumb|LP 570-4 Superleggera.]]
In March 2010, Lamborghini announced the release of the LP 570-4 Superleggera - a lightweight and more powerful version of the Gallardo LP 560-4. Carbon fiber is used extensively inside and out to reduce weight to only {{Convert|2954|lb|abbr=on}} - enough to make the LP 570-4 the lightest road-going Lamborghini in the range. 

The 5.2-liter V10 engine produces 570 horsepower, and can travel from zero to {{Convert|100|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 3.4 seconds, up to a {{Convert|202|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} top speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dieselstation.com/cars/lamborghini-gallardo-lp-570-4-superleggera-2011-a2535.html|title=Lamborghini Gallardo LP 570-4 Superleggera|publisher=DieselStation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2010/03/01/lamborghini-gallardo-lp-570-4-superleggera/|title=Lamborghini Gallardo LP 570-4 Superleggera|publisher=Automoblog.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usedcarscentre.com/News/38|title=Lamborghini Gallardo LP 570-4 Superleggera|publisher=usedcarscentre.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usedcarscentre.com/News/38/ Usedcarscentre.com 2010: Lamborghini Gallardo LP 570-4 Superleggera]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lamborghini Gallardo British police 1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Policing in the United Kingdom|British police]] Gallardo]]
In December 2004, two Gallardos were donated to the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Polizia di Stato|police]] in honour of the force's 152nd anniversary, one came from Automobili Lamborghini SpA while a second was donated by an independent organization.

The Gallardo Police Cars are used by the traffic police ([[Polizia Stradale]]) during emergencies and alarm situations on the [[Autostrada A3 (Italy)|Salerno-Reggio Calabria]] highway, also under the powers of the special safety operative which is already being employed along that tract of highway and above all, for the transport of body organs destined for transplantation.

In October 2008, a private ceremony was held at the Viminale Palace where Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. donated the newest Gallardo, the LP560-4, to the head of the Italian State Police, Prefect Antonio Manganelli. The new Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4 Polizia will replace its predecessor to fulfill roles with the Lazio Highway Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desktopmachine.com/press/612/Lamborghini_Gallardo_LP560-4_Polizia//14474/  Desktopmachine.com], Lamborghini Donates new Gallardo&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, one of the Gallardos was involved in a serious accident near the northern Italian town of Cremona where it was on display at a student jobs fair. A vehicle had come on to the road and had smashed into the front of the Gallardo. This caused it to drive into a set of parked cars, damaging it quite severely on the front.

Yellow Gallardos have been &quot;temporary&quot; police cars for the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] in [[London]], [[England]], one in 2005 and one in 2006, for specific publicity events.  The 2006 vehicle was seen at the start of the 2006 [[Gumball 3000|Gumball Rally]].  Both vehicles were lent by Lamborghini London and were fitted with yellow and blue [[battenburg markings]], police logos and a small blue [[lightbar]].

The Super Trofeo car was also used in the 18-race [http://www.lamborghini.com/supertrofeo/ Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo] one-make racing series, with Swiss watch maker [[Blancpain]] as sponsor.

==Receptions==
In a test drive of LP550-2 Valentino Balboni, the test driver bearing the name of the car said he was against E-gear because it takes some amount of vehicle control away from the driver, and all-wheel drive Lamborghinis from the beginning, and the company was divided over AWD cars. In that review, a LP550-2 with e.gear was tested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2009/08/26/first-drive-kinda-2010-lamborghini-gallardo-lp550-2-valentino/ AutoBlog.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thames Panorama, London - June 2009.jpg|thumb|left|The name ''London'' may derive from the [[River Thames]]|alt=Wide river flanked by tall buildings on either side. There are a number of small boats and one large battleship in the centre of the river. The rooftop dome of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] is visible in the skyline to the right]]
The [[etymology of London|etymology of ''London'']] is uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_139&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mills|2001|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an ancient name and can be found in sources from the 2nd century. It is recorded c. 121 as ''[[Londinium]]'', which points to [[Romano-British]] origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_139&quot;/&gt; The earliest attempted explanation, now disregarded, is attributed to [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_139&quot;/&gt; The name is described as originating from [[Lud son of Heli|King Lud]], who had allegedly taken over the city and named it ''Kaerlud''.&lt;ref name=london_009&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/books/chapters/02-1st-ackro.html?ex=1225339200&amp;en=b9c2c11ad6e1f435&amp;ei=5070|title='London'|last=Ackroyd|first=Peter|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2008-10-28 | date=2001-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1899 it was commonly accepted that the name was of [[Celts|Celtic]] origin and meant ''place belonging to a man called *Londinos''; this explanation has since been rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_139&quot;/&gt; [[Richard Coates]] put forward an explanation in 1998 that it is derived from the pre-Celtic [[Old European hydronymy|Old European]] ''*(p)lowonida'', meaning 'river too wide to ford', and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the [[River Thames]] which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, ''*Lowonidonjon''.&lt;ref name=coates&gt;{{Citation|last=Coates|first=Richard|year=1998|title=A new explanation of the name of London|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|volume=96|issue=2|pages=203–229|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-968X.00027|doi=10.1111/1467-968X.00027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1889 the name officially only applied to the [[City of London]] but since then it has also referred to the [[County of London]] and now [[Greater London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_140&quot;/&gt;

===Prehistory and antiquity===
[[File:London 1300 Historical Atlas William R Shepherd (died 1934).PNG|thumb|left|By 1300 the [[City of London|City]] was still confined within the walls|alt=]]
Although there is evidence of scattered [[Britons (historic)|Brythonic]] settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 43 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=Roman London |last=Perring |first=Dominic |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0203231333|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lasted for just seventeen years and around 61, the [[Iceni]] tribe led by [[Boudica|Queen Boudica]] stormed it, burning it to the ground.&lt;ref name=london_010&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/timeline/romanbritain_timeline_noflash.shtml|title=British History Timeline&amp;nbsp;— Roman Britain|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next, heavily planned incarnation of the city prospered and superseded [[Colchester]] as the capital of the [[Roman Britain|Roman province]] of [[Britannia]] in 100. At its height during the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000. By the 7th century, the [[Anglo-Saxons]] had created a new settlement called [[Anglo-Saxon London|Lundenwic]] over a mile (2&amp;nbsp;km) upstream from the old Roman city, around what is now [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].&lt;ref name=london_011&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Lundenwic.htm|title=The early years of Lundenwic|publisher=The [[Museum of London]]|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that there was a harbour at the mouth of the [[River Fleet]] for fishing and trading, and this trading grew, until the city was overcome by the [[Viking]]s and forced to move east, back to the location of the Roman ''Londinium'', in order to use its walls for protection.&lt;ref name=london_012&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/Onlineresources/RWWC/themes/1295/1288|title=Viking and Danish London|publisher=The [[Museum of London]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viking attacks continued to increase, until 886 when [[Alfred the Great]] recaptured London and made peace with the Danish leader, [[Guthrum]].&lt;ref name=london_013&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Permanent/medieval/Themes/1033/1035/default.htm|title=Medieval London&amp;nbsp;— Vikings|publisher=The [[Museum of London]]|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Saxon city of Lundenwic became ''Ealdwic'' (&quot;old city&quot;), a name surviving to the present day as [[Aldwych]], which is in the modern [[City of Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2fIgAAAAMAAJ |page=xiii |title=London |author=George Hamilton Cunningham |year=1927 |publisher=J.

[[Cnut the Great|Canute]] took control of the English throne in 1016, controlling the city and country until 1035, when his death resulted in a reversion to [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] control under his pious stepson [[Edward the Confessor]], who re-founded [[Westminster Abbey]] and the adjacent [[Palace of Westminster]].&lt;ref name=london_014&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/edward_confessor.shtml|title=Edward the Confessor (c.1003–1066)|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, London had become the largest and most prosperous city in England, although the official [[seat of government]] was still at [[Winchester]]. Following a victory at the [[Battle of Hastings]], [[William the Conqueror]], the then [[Duke of Normandy]], was crowned [[King of England]] in the newly finished Westminster Abbey on [[Christmas Day]] 1066.&lt;ref name=london_015&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/normans/1066_06.shtml|title=History – 1066 – King William|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; William granted the [[City of London|citizens of London]] special privileges, while building what is now known as the [[Tower of London]], in the southeast corner of the city, to keep them under control.&lt;ref name=london_016&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/architecture_02.shtml|title=A History of British Architecture&amp;nbsp;— White Tower|last=Tinniswood|first=Adrian |authorlink=Adrian Tinniswood|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern===
[[File:Great Fire London.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Fire of London]] destroyed many parts of the city in 1666|alt=]]
During the [[Tudor period]] the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] produced a gradual shift to [[Protestantism]], with much of London passing from church to private ownership.&lt;ref name=pevsner&gt;[[Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''London I: The Cities of London and Westminster'' rev. edition,1962, Introduction p 48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercantilism]] grew and monopoly trading companies such as the [[British East India Company]] were established, with trade expanding to the [[New World]]. London became the principal [[North Sea]] port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt;

In the 16th century [[William Shakespeare]] and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the [[Elizabethan theatre|theatre]]. By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an [[assassination]] attempt on [[James I of England|James I]] in Westminster, through the [[Gunpowder Plot]] on 5 November 1605.&lt;ref name=london_023&gt;{{Citation |title=James I |last=Durston |first=Christopher|year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0415077796 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; London was [[Bubonic plague|plagued]] by disease in the early 17th century,&lt;ref name=london_024&gt;{{Citation|url=http://urbanrim.org.uk/plague%20list.htm |title=&quot;A List of National Epidemics of Plague in England 1348–1665&quot; |publisher=Urbanrim.org.uk |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.&lt;ref name=london_025&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/plague/story.html Story of the plague].

In the east, the [[Port of London]] expanded downstream.

In 1762 [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] acquired [[Buckingham Palace|Buckingham House]] and it was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was dogged by [[crime]] and the [[Bow Street Runners]] were established in 1750 as a professional police force.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.pbs.org/kqed/demonbarber/madding/thieftaker.html Thief Taker, Constable, Police]&quot;.

===Late modern and contemporary===
[[File:LondonBombedWWII full.jpg|thumb|A London street hit during [[the Blitz]] of World War II|alt=]]
London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925.&lt;ref name=london_030&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/i-m/london4.html|title=London: The greatest city |publisher=Channel4.com|accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; London's overcrowded conditions led to [[cholera]] epidemics,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/themes/publichealth/cholera.aspx Hidden extras: cholera comes to Victorian London]&quot;. Science Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.uncp.edu/home/rwb/london_19c.html London in the Nineteenth Century]&quot;. The University of North Carolina and Pembroke.&lt;/ref&gt; Rising [[traffic congestion]] led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] oversaw infrastructure expansion. It was replaced in 1889 by the [[London County Council]], London's first elected city-wide administration. [[The Blitz]] and other bombing by the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' during [[World War II]] killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across London. Immediately after the war, the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] were held at the original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], at a time when the city had barely recovered from the war.

In 1951 the [[Festival of Britain]] was held on the [[South Bank]]. The [[Great Smog of 1952]] led to the [[Clean Air Act 1956]], which ended the &quot;[[pea soup fog|pea-souper]]&quot; fogs for which London had been notorious. From the 1950s onwards, London became home to a large number of immigrants, largely from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as [[Jamaica]], India, [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]], making London one of the most diverse cities in Europe.

Starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide [[youth culture]], exemplified by the [[Swinging London]] subculture associated with [[Carnaby Street]]. The role of trendsetter was revived during the [[punk rock|punk]] era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new [[Greater London Council]] was created. During [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], London was subjected to [[terrorism|terrorist]] attacks by the [[Provisional IRA]]. Racial inequality was highlighted by the [[1981 Brixton riot]]. Greater London's population declined steadily in the decades after [[World War II]], from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to [[Port of Felixstowe|Felixstowe]] and [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury]], with the [[London Docklands]] area becoming a focus for regeneration.

The [[Thames Barrier]] was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the [[North Sea]]. The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, which left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration. In 2000, London-wide government was restored, with the creation of the [[Greater London Authority]]. To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the [[Millennium Dome]], [[London Eye]] and [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millenium Bridge]] were constructed. On 7 July 2005, several [[London Underground]] trains and a bus were bombed in a [[7 July 2005 London bombings|series of terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref name=london_031&gt;{{Citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/london_blasts/what_happened/html/default.stm|title=7 July Bombings: Overview |publisher=BBC News | location = London |accessdate=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
===Local government===
{{Main|Local government in London|History of local government in London|List of heads of London government}}
[[File:CityHallLondon2007.JPG|thumb|The [[Greater London Authority]] is based in [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]], Southwark|alt=]]
The administration of London is formed of two tiers—a city-wide, strategic tier and a local tier. City-wide administration is coordinated by the [[Greater London Authority]] (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.&lt;ref name=london_032&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/|title=About the Greater London Authority|publisher=London Government|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLA consists of two elected components; the [[Mayor of London]], who has executive powers, and the [[London Assembly]], who scrutinise the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject his budget proposals each year.

The headquarters of the GLA is [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]], [[Southwark]]; the current mayor is [[Boris Johnson]]. The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the [[London Plan]], which as of mid-2009 is being revised, for final publication in 2011. The local authorities are the councils of the 32 [[London borough]]s and the [[City of London Corporation]].&lt;ref name=london_035&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london/links.jsp|title=Links to other websites&amp;nbsp;— London boroughs|publisher=London Government|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, [[social work|social services]], local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as [[Waste disposal authorities in London|waste management]], a provided through joint arrangements.

[[Police|Policing]] in Greater London, with the exception of the [[City of London]], is provided by the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police Force]], overseen by the [[Metropolitan Police Authority]]. The City of London has its own police force&amp;nbsp;– the [[City of London Police]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Policing&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/policing.jsp|title=Policing|publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Transport Police]] are responsible for police services on [[National Rail]] and [[London Underground]] services in the capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;BTP&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.btp.police.uk/about_us/areas.aspx|title=Areas|publisher=British Transport Police|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[London Fire Brigade]] is the [[statute|statutory]] [[Fire service in the UK|fire and rescue service]] for Greater London.

===National government===
London is an important city because the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] is located around
the [[Palace of Westminster]]. Many government departments are located close to Parliament, particularly along [[Whitehall]], including the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister's]] residence at [[10 Downing Street]].&lt;ref name=london_036&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page1.asp|title=10 Downing Street&amp;nbsp;— Official Website|publisher=10 Downing Street|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Parliament is often referred to as the &quot;Mother of Parliaments&quot; (although this ''[[sobriquet]]'' was first applied to England itself by [[John Bright]])&lt;ref name=london_037&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/96021.stm |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2008-06-06 |date=1998-06-03 |title=UK Politics: Talking Politics&amp;nbsp;— The 'Mother of Parliaments'}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it has been the model for most other [[parliamentary system]]s, and its Acts have created many other parliaments.&lt;!-- **Incomplete sentence** There are 74 [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) from London, who correspond to local parliamentary [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Greater London|constituencies]] in the national [[British House of Commons|Parliament]] by .&lt;ref name=london_038&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/4293078.stm|title=London: Ethnic vote |date=30 September 2005|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these 74 MPs, 44 are from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], 21 are [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], 8 are [[Liberal Democrats]] and one is from the [[Respect&amp;nbsp;– The Unity Coalition|RESPECT]] party.--&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of London}}
===Scope===
[[File:Central London Andh.svg|thumb|Map of Central London|alt=]]
[[Greater London]] is the top-level administrative subdivision covering London. The small, ancient [[City of London]] at its core once contained the whole settlement, but as the urban area grew the [[Corporation of the City of London|City Corporation]] resisted attempts to amalgamate it with its suburbs, causing &quot;London&quot; to be defined in a number ways for different purposes; and the situation was once open to legal debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;chancery&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Beavan|first=Charles|coauthors=Bickersteth, Harry|title=Reports of Cases in Chancery, Argued and Determined in the Rolls Court|publisher=Saunders and Benning|year=1865|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YFYDAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty percent of Greater London is covered by the [[London postal district|London]] post town, within which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.&lt;ref name=london_042&gt;{{Citation|last=Stationery Office|title=The Inner London Letter Post|publisher=H.M.S.O|year=1980|isbn=0102515808|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=map_post&gt;{{citation|title=London Postcode and Administrative Boundaries|publisher=Geographers' A-Z Map Company|author=Geographers' A-Z Map Company|year=2008|edition=6|isbn=9781843485926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are omitted and some places just outside are included. The area within the orbital [[M25 motorway]] is normally what is referred to as 'London'.&lt;ref name=london_043&gt;{{Citation|last=Mail|first=Royal|title=Address Management Guide|publisher=Royal Mail|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Greater London boundary has been [[List of Greater London boundary changes|aligned to it]] in places.&lt;ref name=london_044&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19930441_en_1.htm|title=The Essex, Greater London and Hertfordshire (County and London Borough Boundaries) Order|year=1993|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive [[marshland]]s; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.&lt;ref name=london_065&gt;{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=M9qvtYYhRtAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=thames+%22iron+age%22+london+wide+geography+shallow+marsh&amp;ots=wVDtRsVF-V&amp;sig=GFqR9QKs45u-ggfYI0dcCA3GUzc#PPA10,M1|title=''London: A History'', by Francis Sheppard page 10.|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Victorian era]] the Thames has been extensively [[Thames Embankment|embanked]], and many of its London [[tributary|tributaries]] now flow [[Subterranean rivers of London|underground]]. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.&lt;ref name=london_066&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/flooding/?version=1&amp;lang=_e|title=Flooding|publisher=UK [[Environment Agency]]|accessdate=2006-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat has increased over time due to a slow but continuous rise in [[Tide|high water]] level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-[[glacier|glacial]] [[isostatic rebound|rebound]].&lt;ref name=london_067&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/sealevels/?version=1&amp;lang=_e|title=&quot;Sea Levels&quot; – UK Environment Agency|publisher=[[Environment Agency]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, a decade of work began on the construction of the [[Thames Barrier]] across the Thames at [[Woolwich]] to deal with this threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=David|last=Adam|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/mar/31/thames-flood-barrier-london|title=Thames Barrier gets extra time as London's main flood defence|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2009-03-31|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of the United Kingdom}}

London has a [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|marine climate]] ([[Koppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), like much of the British Isles, so the city rarely sees extremely high or low temperatures. Summers are warm with a July high of {{convert|22.8|C|1}} and low of {{convert|14.0|C|1}}.&lt;ref name = GreenwichStats /&gt; But temperatures can exceed {{convert|25|°C|°F}} on many days, and in almost every year they exceed {{convert|30|°C|°F}} on some days. The highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|38|°C|0}} &lt;ref name=&quot;AverageWeatherLondon&quot;&gt;{{Citation
  |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003790
  |title=Average Conditions, London, United Kingdom
  |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]
  |accessdate=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 10 August 2003 during the [[2003 European heat wave]].

Winters in London are chilly, but rarely below freezing (although in recent years this has been questionable) with daytime highs around {{convert||5°C|°F}}&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|8|°C|°F}}, while spring has mild  days and cool evenings.&lt;ref name=&quot;AverageWeatherLondon&quot; /&gt; The lowest ever recorded temperature was {{convert|-21.1|°C|0}} in January 1795. Autumn is usually mild but often unsettled as colder air from the arctic and warmer air from the tropics meet. London is a relatively dry city with regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year, with an average of {{convert|583.6|mm|in}} every year. This is lower than many cities such as [[New York City|New York]], [[Paris]], [[Sydney]] and around the same as [[San Francisco]] and even [[Jerusalem]]. 

London receives an average of only 1461 hours of sunshine every year.&lt;ref name = GreenwichStats /&gt;

Snow is relatively uncommon, particularly because [[urban heat island|heat from the urban area]] can make London up to 5&amp;nbsp;°C (9&amp;nbsp;°F) warmer than the surrounding areas in winter. Some snowfall, however, is usually seen up to a few times a year. The [[February 2009 Great Britain and Ireland snowfall]] was the heaviest London had seen for 18 years.

London is in [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Hardiness zone]] 9, and [[Hardiness zone|AHS Heat Zone 2]].&lt;ref name=london_069&gt;{{Citation

[[Tornado]]s are rare, but the [[Kensal Green]] area of the city was hit by the [[2006 London tornado]] causing £10 million of damage and injuring 6 people. In the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th, London was noted for its dense fogs and smogs. Following the deadly [[Great Smog of 1952]], the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] was passed, leading to the decline of such severe pollution in the capital.&lt;ref name=london_070&gt;{{Citation

London's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names, such as [[Bloomsbury]], [[Mayfair]], [[Wembley]] and [[Whitechapel]]. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or [[Metropolitan boroughs of the County of London|former boroughs]].

Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without current official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 [[London borough]]s in addition to the ancient City of London.&lt;ref name=london_071&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/boroughs.jsp|title=London boroughs&amp;nbsp;— London Life, GLA|publisher=London Government|accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=london_072&gt;{{Citation|last=Dogan|first=Mattei|coauthors=John D.

The [[West End of London|West End]] is London's main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists.&lt;ref name=london_075&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1608619.stm |title=West End still drawing crowds |work=BBC |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-06-06 | date=2001-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[West (London sub region)|West London]] includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds.&lt;ref name=london_076&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2006/apr/17/tax.g2|title=Super Rich|date=17 April 2006|publisher=The Guardian Money|accessdate=2008-06-07 | location=London | first=James | last=Meek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average price for properties in [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|Kensington and Chelsea]] is £894,000 with similar average outlay in most of [[Central London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;London's Properties&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://rbkc.gov.uk/Planning/localdevelopmentframework/ldf_hs_appendix_a2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Price of Properties.|publisher=Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture in London|List of tallest structures in London}}
[[File:30 St Mary Axe - The Gherkin from Leadenhall St - Nov 2006.jpg|thumb|London's architecture ranges from very old to modern]]
London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular [[architectural]] style, having been built over a long period of time. Notable recent buildings are the 1980s skyscraper [[Tower 42]], the [[Lloyd's building]] with services running along the outside of the structure, and the 2004 [[30 St Mary Axe|Swiss Re building]], known as ''&quot;the Gherkin&quot;''. London's generally low-rise nature makes these skyscrapers and others such as [[One Canada Square]] and its neighbours at [[Canary Wharf]] and the [[BT Tower]] in [[Fitzrovia]] very noticeable from a distance.

High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]]. Nevertheless, there are plans for more skyscrapers in [[Central London]] ''(see [[Tall buildings in London]])'', including the 72-storey [[Shard London Bridge|&quot;Shard of Glass&quot;]], which will be one of the tallest buildings in Europe. Older buildings are mainly [[brick]] built, most commonly the yellow [[London stock brick]] or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster [[molding (decorative)|mouldings]].&lt;ref name=london_077&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=A1&amp;xml=/property/2008/03/27/lpgreen127.xml|title=Eco homes: Wooden it be lovely... ?|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=2008-10-12 | location=London | first=Sarah | last=Lonsdale | date=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], are constructed from [[Portland stone]]. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white [[stucco]] or whitewashed buildings. Few structures pre-date the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of 1666, except for a few trace [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains, the [[Tower of London]] and a few scattered [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] survivors in the City. [[Christopher Wren|Wren]]'s late 17th century churches and the financial institutions of the 18th and 19th centuries such as the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]] and the [[Bank of England]], to the early 20th century [[Old Bailey]] and the 1960s [[Barbican Estate]] form part of the varied architectural heritage.
[[File:Buckingham Palace and Victoria Monument - September 2006.jpg|left|thumb|[[Buckingham Palace]] is the official residence of the British monarch|alt=]]
The disused, but soon to be rejuvenated, 1939 [[Battersea Power Station]] by the river in the southwest is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of [[Victorian architecture]], most notably [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]] and [[Paddington railway station|Paddington]].&lt;ref name=london_078&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Paddington_Station.html|title=Paddington Station.|publisher=Great Buildings|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The density of London varies, with high employment density in the [[Central London|central area]], high residential densities in [[inner London]] and lower densities in the [[Outer London|suburbs]].

In the dense areas, most of the concentration is achieved with medium- and [[high-rise]] buildings. London's [[skyscraper]]s such as [[30 St Mary Axe|&quot;Gherkin&quot;]], [[Tower 42]], the [[Broadgate Tower]] and [[One Canada Square]] are usually found in the two financial districts, the [[City of London]] and [[Canary Wharf]]. Other notable modern buildings include [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]] in [[Southwark]] with its distinctive oval shape,&lt;ref name=london_079&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2129199.stm|title=Inside London's new 'glass egg'|date= 16 July 2002|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Library]] in [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]]/[[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]]. What was formerly the [[Millennium Dome]], located by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now used as an entertainment venue known as [[The O2 (London)|The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].

[[The Monument]] in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the [[Great Fire of London]], which originated nearby. [[Marble Arch]] and [[Wellington Arch]], at the north and south ends of [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] respectively, have royal connections, as do the [[Albert Memorial]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[Kensington]]. [[Nelson's Column]] is a nationally recognised monument in [[Trafalgar Square]], one of the focal points of the centre.

===Parks and gardens===
{{Main|Parks and open spaces in London|Royal Parks of London}}
The largest parks in the central area of London are the [[Royal Parks of London|Royal Parks]] of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], its neighbour [[Kensington Gardens]] at the western edge of [[Central London]] and [[Regent's Park]] on the northern edge.&lt;ref name=london_080&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/kensington_gardens/|title=Kensington Gardens|year=2008|publisher=The Royal Parks|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regent's Park contains [[London Zoo]], the world's oldest scientific zoo, and is located near the tourist attraction of [[Madame Tussauds]] Wax Museum.&lt;ref name=london_081&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.madametussauds.com/London/About.aspx|title=Madame Tussauds&amp;nbsp;— Official website|publisher=Madame Tussauds|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=london_082&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.tourist-information-uk.com/madame-tussauds.htm|title=Madame Tussauds&amp;nbsp;— Tourist Information|publisher=Tourist Information UK|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of large parks lie outside the city centre, including the remaining Royal Parks of [[Greenwich Park]] to the south-east&lt;ref name=london_170&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/greenwich_park/|title=Greenwich Park|year=2008|publisher=The Royal Parks|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bushy Park]] and [[Richmond Park]] to the south-west,&lt;ref name=london_084&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/bushy_park/|title=Bushy Park|year=2008|publisher=The Royal Parks|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=london_085&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/richmond_park/|title=Richmond Park|year=2008|publisher=The Royal Parks|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Victoria Park, East London]] to the east. [[Primrose Hill]] to the north of Regent's Park is a popular spot to view the city skyline.

Some more informal, semi-natural open spaces also exist, including the {{convert|320|ha|acre|sing=on}} [[Hampstead Heath]] of [[North London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Parks_and_open_spaces/Hampstead_Heath/|title=City of London Corporation Hampstead Heath|publisher=City of London Corporation|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This incorporates [[Kenwood House]], the former [[stately home]] and a popular location in the summer months where classical musical concerts are held by the lake, attracting thousands of people every weekend to enjoy the music, scenery and fireworks.&lt;ref name=london_086&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.00100200800k00800f|title=Kenwood House |publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
{{Main|Demography of London}}
{{TableLondonTop21BirthCountry}}&lt;!--- Ref name=Pop2001 ---&gt;
With increasing industrialisation, London's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world until overtaken by New York in 1925. Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. There were an estimated 7,556,900 official residents in [[Greater London]] as of mid-2007.&lt;ref name=Greater_London_population /&gt;

However, London's continuous urban area extends beyond the borders of Greater London and was home to 8,278,251 people in 2001,&lt;ref name=urban_area_pop /&gt; while its wider [[London metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] has a population of between 12 and 14&amp;nbsp;million depending on the definition used.&lt;ref name=&quot;London Metropolitan Population&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.demographia.com/dm-lonarea.htm|accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Eurostat]], London is the [[Largest cities and metropolitan areas in the European Union (Eurostat)|most populous city and metropolitan area of the European Union]] and the second [[Largest European cities and metropolitan areas|most populous]] in Europe (or third if [[Istanbul]] is included). During the period 1991–2001 a net 726,000&amp;nbsp;immigrants arrived in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Immigration&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article379434.ece|title=Immigration rise increases segregation in British cities|last=Leppard|first=David|date=2005-04-10|work=Times Online|publisher=TimesOnline.co.uk|accessdate=2009-08-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic groups===
{{Main|Ethnic groups in London}}

In 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the [[London Overground]] network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The [[public transport]] network is administered by [[Transport for London]] (TfL) and is one of the most extensive in the world. [[Cycling in London|Cycling]] is an increasingly popular way to get around London. The [[London Cycling Campaign]] lobbies for better provision.&lt;ref name=london_122&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.lcc.org.uk/|title=London Cycling Campaign|date=20 November 2006|publisher=Rosanna Downes|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB) or ''[[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]]'' was created. [[Transport for London]] (TfL), is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the [[Mayor of London]].&lt;ref name=stat_tfl&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp#transport|title=How do I find out about transport in London? |publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buses and trams===
[[File:Routemaster bus alongside new bus.jpg|thumb|right 250px|The red [[double-decker bus]] is an iconic symbol of London]]
London's [[London buses|bus network]] is one of the largest in the world, running 24 hours a day, with 8,000 buses, 700 bus routes, and over 6 million passenger journeys made every weekday. In 2003, the network's ridership was estimated at over 1.5 billion passenger trips per annum, more than the Underground.&lt;ref name=london_130&gt;{{Citation |author=[[Transport for London]] |title=London Buses |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/1548.aspx |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around £850 million is taken in revenue each year.

London has a modern tram network, known as [[Tramlink]], based in [[Croydon]] in [[South London]]. The network has 39 stops, three routes and carried 26.5 million people in 2008. Since June 2008 [[Transport for London]] has completely owned Tramlink and plans to spend £54m by 2015 on maintenance, renewals, upgrades and capacity enhancements. Since April 2009 all trams have been refurbished.&lt;ref name=london_134&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/tramlink-factsheet.pdf|date=Summer 2009|publisher=Transport for London|title=Tramlink Factsheet|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5 - Passenger area.jpg|thumb|right|[[London Heathrow Airport]] is the [[World's busiest airport|busiest airport in the world]] for international traffic &lt;ref name=london_135&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/|title=BAA Heathrow: Official Website|publisher=BAA|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=]]
London is a major international air transport hub with the largest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word ''London'' in their name, but most traffic passes through only five. [[London Heathrow Airport]], in [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]], West London, is the [[World's busiest airport|busiest airport in the world]] for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, [[British Airways]].&lt;ref name=london_135 /&gt; In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened,&lt;ref name=london_137&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.heathrow-airport-uk.info/heathrow-airport-terminal-5.htm|title=Heathrow Airport Terminal 5|publisher=TMC Ltd|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plans are already being considered for a sixth terminal&lt;ref name=london_138&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/portal/site/heathrow/menuitem.2ea84de4d9bc8a0ca4b12871120103a0/%3bjsessionid=DNAfOXj7g3r3fk1j9NlWANpydf0hhlQvi8LcmzuRluuyU0u2FTlo!-949195938|title=About Heathrow|publisher=BAA Heathrow|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Similar traffic, with the addition of some [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] [[short-haul]] flights, is also handled at [[London Gatwick Airport]], located south of London in [[West Sussex]].&lt;ref name=london_139&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.gatwickairport.com/|title=BAA Gatwick: Gatwick Airport|publisher=BAA|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[London Stansted Airport|Stansted Airport]], situated north east of London in [[Essex]], is the main UK hub for [[Ryanair]] and [[London Luton Airport|Luton Airport]] to the north of London in [[Bedfordshire]], caters mostly for low-cost short-haul flights.&lt;ref name=london_140&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.stanstedairport.com/|title=BAA Stansted : Stansted Airport|year=2008|publisher=BAA|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=london_141&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.london-luton.co.uk/en/|title=London Luton Airport|publisher=London Luton Airport|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London City Airport]], the smallest and most central airport, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable [[business jet]] traffic.&lt;ref name=london_142&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.londoncityairport.com/Default.aspx|title=London City Airport&amp;nbsp;— Corporate Information|publisher=London City Airport Ltd.|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roads===
[[File:Buses at Piccadilly Circus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Traffic congestion in Central London]]
Although the majority of journeys involving [[Central London]] are made by [[public transport]], car travel is common in the suburbs. The [[London Inner Ring Road|inner ring road]] (around the city centre), the [[A406 road|North]] and [[A205 road|South Circular]] roads (in the suburbs), and the outer orbital [[motorway]] (the [[M25 motorway|M25]], outside the built-up area) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into [[inner London]]. The M25 is the longest ring-road motorway in the world at {{convert|195.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name=london_143&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/travel/m25/m25_facts.shtml |title=Beds, Herts and Bucks Travel&amp;nbsp;— All you need to know about the M25 |publisher=BBC |date=1988-08-17 |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the [[London Ringways|Ringways Plan]]) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s. In 2003, a [[London congestion charge|congestion charge]] was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay £8 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of congested Central London.&lt;ref name=london_144&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/roadusers/congestioncharge/whereandwhen/|title=Charging Zone | Transport for London | Where and when|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=london_145&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/6741.aspx|title=Who pays what | Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a vastly reduced season pass which is renewed monthly and is cheaper than a corresponding bus fare.&lt;ref name=london_146&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/6735.aspx|title=Residents | Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; London is notorious for its traffic congestion, with the M25 motorway the busiest stretch in the country. The average speed of a car in the rush hour is 10.6&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name=london_147&gt;{{Citation|accessdate=2009-09-01|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/mar/16/boris-johnson-congestion-charge|title= Boris Johnson mulls 'intelligent' congestion charge system for London|publisher=The Guardian | first=Hélène | last=Mulholland | date=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Education in London}}
[[File:UCL Portico Building.jpg|thumb|[[University College London]] is part of the [[University of London]]|alt=]]
Home to a range of universities, colleges and schools, London has a student population of about 378,000 and is a centre of [[research and development]]. Most primary and secondary schools in London follow the [[Education in England|same system as the rest of England]]—comprehensive schooling.
With 125,000 students, the [[University of London]] is the largest contact teaching university in the United Kingdom and in Europe.&lt;ref name=london_148&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.london.ac.uk/aboutus|title=About the University|date=2006-02-20|publisher=University of London|accessdate=2006-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises 20 colleges as well as several smaller institutes each with a high degree of autonomy.

Constituent colleges have their own [[University and college admissions|admissions]] procedures, and are effectively universities in their own right, although most degrees are awarded by the University of London rather than the individual colleges.

[[File:Brunel university entrance.jpg|thumb|[[Brunel University]] is one of the many universities in London|alt=]]
A number of colleges are dedicated to the fine arts, including the [[Royal College of Music]], [[Royal College of Art]], and [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]]. London's other universities, such as [[Brunel University]], [[City University, London|City University]], [[London Metropolitan University]], [[Middlesex University]], [[University of East London]], [[University of the Arts London]], [[University of Westminster]], [[Kingston University]] and [[London South Bank University]] are not part of the University of London but are still leaders in their field and popular choices among students both nationally and internationally. Some were [[Institute of technology|polytechnics]] until they were granted university status in [[Further and Higher Education Act, 1992|1992]], and others which were founded much earlier. Imperial College London left the federal University of London in 2007.

Since the merger of [[University of North London]] and [[London Guildhall University]] in 2003, [[London Metropolitan University]] is the largest unitary university in the capital, with over 34,000 students from 155 countries.&lt;ref name=london_157&gt;[http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/o90402_3.pdf About London Met] London Metropolitan University, August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; London is also known globally for its business education, harbouring several top-rated business schools: [[London Business School]], [[Cass Business School]] and [[Imperial College Business School]].&lt;ref name=london_158&gt;{{Citation|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/global-mba-rankings|title=Global MBA Rankings 2009|publisher= Financial Times|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition there are three international universities: [[Schiller International University]], [[Richmond University]] and [[Regent's College]].

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of London}}
===Accent===
The London accent long ago acquired the [[Cockney]] label, and was similar to many accents of the [[South East of England]], of which Cockney [[rhyming slang]] is a part. The accent of a 21st century 'Londoner' varies widely; what is becoming more and more common amongst the under 30s however is some fusion of Cockney, [[Received Pronunciation]], and a whole array of 'ethnic' accents, in particular Caribbean, which form an accent labelled [[Jafaican|Multicultural London English]] (MLE).&lt;ref name=&quot;MCLE&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/jafaican-and-tikkiny-drown-out-the-east-ends-cockney-twang-473688.html|title=Jafaican and Tikkiny drown out the East End's Cockney twang|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|date=2006-04-11|work=The Independent|accessdate=2008-08-22 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dickens by Watkins detail.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Charles Dickens]] (1812–1870)]]
London has been the setting for many works of literature. The literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly [[Hampstead]] and (since the early 20th century) [[Bloomsbury]]. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist [[Samuel Pepys]], noted for his eyewitness account of the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]], [[Charles Dickens]], whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London, and [[Virginia Woolf]], regarded as one of the foremost [[modernist literature|modernist]] literary figures of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;London in Literature&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/speccoll/guides/london/londoninliterature.shtml|title=London in Literature,|publisher=Bryn Mawr College|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Shakespeare]] spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary [[Ben Jonson]] was also based there, and some of his work—most notably his play [[The Alchemist (play)|''The Alchemist'']]—was set in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;London in Literature&quot; /&gt; ''[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]'' (1722) by [[Daniel Defoe]] is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]].&lt;ref name=&quot;London in Literature&quot; /&gt;  Later important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are Dickens' novels, and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;London in Literature&quot; /&gt; Modern writers pervasively influenced by the city include [[Peter Ackroyd]], author of a &quot;biography&quot; of London, and [[Iain Sinclair]], who writes in the genre of [[psychogeography]].

London was the setting for the films ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' (1948), ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' (1955), ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|The 101 Dalmatians]]'' (1961), ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966), ''[[The Long Good Friday]]'' (1980), ''[[Secrets &amp; Lies (film)|Secrets &amp; Lies]]'' (1996), ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'' (1999), ''[[Match Point]]'' (2005), ''[[V For Vendetta (film)|V For Vendetta]]'' (2005) and ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street]]'' (2008). The television [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', first broadcast in 1985, is also set in the city. London has played a significant role in the film industry, and has major studios at [[Ealing Studios|Ealing]] and a [[special effect]]s and [[post-production]] community centred in [[Soho]]. [[Working Title Films]] has its headquarters in London.&lt;ref name=london_165&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.workingtitlefilms.com/|title=Working Title Films|publisher=Universal Studios|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums and art galleries===
{{Main|List of museums in London}}
[[File:Natural History Museum London Jan 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Natural History Museum]].]]
London is [[List of museums in London|home to many museums]], galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major [[tourist attraction]]s as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the [[British Museum]] in [[Bloomsbury]], in 1753. Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. In 1824 the [[National Gallery]] was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in [[Trafalgar Square]]. In the latter half of the nineteenth century the locale of [[South Kensington]] was developed as &quot;[[Albertopolis]]&quot;, a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are located there: the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (for the [[applied arts]]), the [[Natural History Museum]] and the [[London Science Museum|Science Museum]]. The national gallery of British art is at [[Tate Britain]], originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art; in 2000 this collection moved to [[Tate Modern]], a new gallery housed in the former [[Bankside Power Station]].

===Music===
London is one of the major [[Classical music|classical]] and [[popular music]] capitals of the world and is home to major music corporations, such as [[EMI]], as well as countless bands, musicians and industry professionals. London is home to many orchestras and concert halls such as the [[Barbican Arts Centre]] (principal base of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]), [[Cadogan Hall]] ([[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]) and the [[Royal Albert Hall]] ([[BBC Promenade Concerts]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;London's Concerts&quot; /&gt; London's two main opera houses are the [[Royal Opera House]] and the [[Coliseum Theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;London's Concerts&quot; /&gt; London is home to the UK's largest [[pipe organ]], at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Other significant instruments are found at the cathedrals and major churches. Several [[conservatoire]]s are located within the city: [[Royal Academy of Music]], [[Royal College of Music]], [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] and [[Trinity College of Music]].
[[File:BBC Proms 31.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Albert Hall]] hosts concerts and musical events|alt=]]

London has numerous venues for rock and pop concerts, including large arenas such as [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]], [[Wembley Arena]] and the [[The O2 arena (London)|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Arena]], as well as numerous mid-size venues, such as [[Brixton Academy]], [[Hammersmith Apollo]] and the [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;London's Concerts&quot; /&gt; London also hosts many [[music festivals]], including the [[O2 Wireless Festival]]. London is home to the first and original [[Hard Rock Cafe]] and the [[Abbey Road Studios]] where [[the Beatles]] recorded many of their hits. In the 1970s and 1980s, musicians like [[David Bowie]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[Ian Dury|Ian Dury and the Blockheads]], [[the Kinks]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Who]], [[Madness (band)|Madness]], [[the Jam]], [[the Small Faces]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[the Police]], [[the Cure]], [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] and [[Sade (band)|Sade]], took the world by storm, deriving their sound from the streets and rhythms vibrating through London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Top40&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2006/04/06/garycrowley_londontop40_feature.shtml|title=London's top 40 artists|date=2006-04-06|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] London|accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London was instrumental in the development of [[punk music]],&lt;ref name=london_172&gt;{{Citation|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=77:204|work=allmusic|title=Punk|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with figures such as the [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Top40&quot;/&gt; and [[Vivienne Westwood]] all based in the city. More recent artists to emerge from the London music scene include [[Bananarama]], [[Bush (band)|Bush]], [[East 17]], [[Siouxie and the Banshees]], the [[Spice Girls]],  [[Jamiroquai]], [[the Libertines]], [[Babyshambles]], [[Bloc Party]], [[Coldplay]] and [[Amy Winehouse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scene&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.londonbc.co.uk/history-of-music-in-london.html|title=History of music in London|publisher=The London Music Scene|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; London is also a centre for urban music. In particular the genres [[UK garage]], [[drum and bass]], [[dubstep]] and [[grime (music)|grime]] evolved in the city from the foreign genres of [[hip hop]] and [[reggae]], alongside local [[drum and bass]]. Black music station [[BBC 1Xtra]] was set up to support the rise of homegrown urban music both in London and the rest of the UK.

In the 80's London was the main city in the new wave of British [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] era which made bands like [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Motörhead]] famous all around the world.

The Lancer (LA series in [[Australia]], where it was called the Chrysler Valiant Lancer initially) was first launched in January 1973 and proved to be particularly successful in rallies, a claim that it retains to this day. At the time of its launch, Mitsubishi had the [[Mitsubishi Minica|Minica]] [[kei car]] and the [[compact car|compact]] [[Mitsubishi Galant|Galant]], so the Lancer served to fill the gap in the small to lower-medium segment of the growing [[Japan]]ese market. Twelve models were launched, ranging from a basic 1.2 L [[sedan (car)|sedan]] to a more powerful [[rallying|rally]]-derived [[Mitsubishi Lancer 1600 GSR|1600 GSR]] model.

In some Latin American countries, as for example, in [[El Salvador]] the car initially was known as the '''Dodge Lancer'''.

There were four body styles, 2-door and 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedans]], a 2-door [[hardtop]] [[coupe]] and a rarely seen 5-door [[station wagon]].

=== Celeste ===
[[File:Lancer celeste in antigua gt.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-facelift Lancer Celeste ST]]In February 1975, the Lancer was complemented by a [[hatchback]] coupé called the '''Mitsubishi Lancer Celeste''' (also called the '''Mitsubishi Celeste''' or '''Colt Celeste''' in some markets; it was the '''Chrysler Lancer Coupé''' in [[Australia]], the '''Dodge Lancer Celeste''' in [[El Salvador]] and the '''[[Plymouth Arrow]]''' in the [[United States]]), and sold with 1.4 L and 1.6 L options  (a 2.0 L model was added later).

=== First generation facelift (1979-1983) ===
[[File:1980LCLancer.jpg|thumb|left|1980 LC Lancer]]

A facelifted Lancer followed soon in 1979, called the LB series in Australia (without the Valiant tag). It was this series that emerged in the United States as the Dodge Colt for the 1977 model year, taking over from a badge-engineered [[Mitsubishi Galant]] from the previous year. It was offered for one more model year before the Dodge Colt name was transferred to the [[front wheel drive]] [[Mitsubishi Mirage]].

In 1979, the '''Lancer EX''' was unveiled in Japan. Only two engines were offered at the time, a 1.4 L MCA-JET equipped engine paired with Mitsubishi's Silent Shaft Technology, which generated {{Convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 1.6 L engine that generated {{Convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The MCA-JET system was an entirely new concept when compared with the previously used carburetor system. The MCA stands for Mitsubishi Clean Air which meant that the EX passed both Japan and US emission standards, while the new cylinder head design of the engine gave way for a Jet valve which introduced an extra swirl of air to the combustion chamber, swirling the fuel-air mixture for a cleaner, efficient and more thorough burn. 

In addition to these improvements, another breakthrough in the Lancer lineup was the Silent Shaft Technology, which was actually two counterbalancing shafts that rotated in opposite directions, cancelling the power pulses inherent in an inline 4 cylinder engine. This reduced both engine noise and vibration, and provided a smoother driving experience. The 1.8 L Sirius 80 engines were then introduced in the Lancer in 1980, along with a new {{Convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, 1.2 L engine a year later, providing a broader range of engines for the Mitsubishi's Lancer. Also, a turbocharged, {{convert|135|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} engine was added in 1980 for sportier performance, and an Intercooler system was also integrated in the existing turbocharged engine to produce {{convert|165|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} in 1983.

=== Lancer EX 1800GSR and GT Turbo ===
In 1980, The Lancer EX was introduced with a 1.8 L turbocharged 4-cylinder option known as the 1800GSR and GT Turbo. The first generation 1800GSR and GT were only available with a turbocharged, non-intercooled {{convert|135|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. However, in 1983, an intercooler was introduced, helping the turbocharged mill to produce {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}..

=== Lancer EX 2000 Turbo ===
[[File:Lancer EX 2000 Turbo 1000Lakes Rally Car.jpg|thumb|left|Rally Version of the Lancer EX 2000 Turbo]]
In Europe,  the Lancer EX was offered with a turbocharged 2.0 L 4–cylinder engine known as the Lancer EX 2000 Turbo. It was the first Lancer to use the very first 4g63 engine which was then used in succeeding models such as the [[Mitsubishi Galant VR-4|Galant VR-4]] and the [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution|Lancer Evolution]] I to IX. 

It achieved a maximum output of {{convert|168|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and manages a top speed of {{convert|125|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and a quarter mile time of less than 15.5 s. A new feature on this model is that it is equipped with ECI or Advanced Electronically-Controlled Fuel Injection which gave the Lancer more power and outstanding fuel economy as it did 23.0 [[mile per gallon|mpg]] in city driving and 28.8 to 37.2 mpg in highway driving. A rally version of the Lancer EX 2000 Turbo was made for the 1000 Lakes Rally that gave out {{convert|280|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. Sales of this model were low because of emission regulations Japan imposed at that time.

=== Philippines (1979-1989) ===
In The Philippines, the Lancer EX (which is popularly known as the Box Type Lancer) was offered with three variants. These variants are the SL, GSR, and GT. All engines were equipped with the Silent Shaft Technology (the SL had the 1.4 L MCA-JET engine) and soon after, Automatic was available for SL and GSR variants. Sales stopped in 1989 since it was to be replaced by the Fourth generation Lancer.

==== Model and trim levels ====
* '''SL''' - Base Model. 4-door sedan powered by a 1.4L engine with a 4-speed Manual Transmission and later introduced with the 1.2 L engine (4G11) alongside with the 3-speed Automatic Transmission
* '''GSR''' - Mid Range Model. 4-door sedan powered by a 1.6L engine with a 5-speed Manual Transmission. 3-speed Automatic Transmission along with a 1.8L engine option (4G62 - carb ver.) was then introduced.
* '''GT''' - Limited Edition version with the Lancer EX Turbo Bodykit, 14&quot; alloy rims, and same 1.6L engine.

=== Other markets ===
The Lancer EX (the Lancer name was used, and excluding Japan) was sold throughout the Asia and the Pacific (Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Australia, New Zealand). It was also sold in South America.

In 1982, a special model was launched called the '''Lancer Fiore''', also known as third version of the Lancer, based on the Mitsubishi Mirage. The Fiore was often sold as a Lancer in international markets, but also the Mirage Sedan and, with the five-door [[hatchback]] model, remained in production for a good part of the 1980s. In Australia, it would eventually be sold as the Mitsubishi Colt Sedan although cosmetically different. Thus, Mitsubishi had two similarly sized models competing in the same market segment.

The Lancer Fiore/Third generation was discontinued in 1984, just two years after its original launch. The second generation Lancer was, however, still in production for another 4 years when until 1988.

Both Mirage and Lancer lines were later renewed from the third generation.

The Mirage four-door and Lancer sedan became the same car. The Lancer Fiore incorporated the latest in computer control engine technology including an electronic fuel injection for its high performance 1600cc turbocharged engine with a power output of 120ps. For the fuel conscious, a 1800cc diesel engine was added as well as the new 1500cc MD (Modulated Displacement) engine which was developed by Mitsubishi Motors and introduced to the market for the first time.

[[File:Mitsubishi Lancer 3 Estate Cottenham.jpg|left|thumb|1987 Mitsubishi Lancer 5-Door]]

In 1985, the Lancer [[station wagon]], also marketed as the Mirage Station Wagon was introduced to address expanding user needs and to extend the versatility of the Lancer lineup. The following year saw the addition of a full-time [[four wheel drive]] version. This model went on to become very popular in both the commercial and private sectors overseas as well as in Japan. 

This model formed the basis of the original [[Proton (company)|Proton]] sedan, the [[Proton Saga|Saga]], which was still in production until early 2008. However, in the Philippines, this generation of Lancer was not sold through Mitsubishi dealers.

In 1988, a more aerodynamic-looking Lancer was launched, following the shape of the Galant. A five-door hatchback was added to the range. The Mirage and Lancer nomenclature continued. The station wagon continued on the old platform and shape, as did, in some markets, a five-door version of the Mirage. In Australia, all models were sold as the Mitsubishi Lancer, initially designated as the  CA series and from 1990 as the CB. By that time, the Lancer name was shared with the [[Dodge Lancer]] sold in [[North America]]. The sedan was sold as the Mirage Aspire in Japan.

In some markets a 'van' model was produced, being the three-door hatchback without rear side windows (attracting a reduced sales tax in the Dutch market).

In the Philippines, the Fifth generation lancer is also known as &quot;Lancer singkit&quot;. &quot;Singkit&quot; is a Tagalog word that describes the typical almond-shape that the [[epicanthic fold]] gives the eyes of East Asians. It is a reference to the shape of the headlamps and turn signals which taper at the sides. The headlamps of the previous generation were rectangular in comparison.

It was only in 1991 that there was greater differentiation between the Mirage and Lancer. Although both were on the same platform, the Lancer sedan received different sheetmetal from the Mirage four-door. The Mirage variant was sold in North America under the [[Eagle Summit]] name. [[Minivan]] models, such as the [[Mitsubishi Space Runner]] and [[Mitsubishi Chariot]], were mechanically related. In 1993, the Lancer wagon, named the '''Libero''' in [[Japan]], was launched. 

An electric version was also released named the '''Libero EV''' that ran on [[NiCd]] batteries. A [[V6]] variant was also introduced with only 1.6 L, making it the [[List of automotive superlatives#Engine capacity|smallest mass-produced V6]]. The high-performance, turbocharged ''GSR'' version formed the basis of the contemporary [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution|Lancer Evolution]] (or 'Lancer Evo') from September 1993, using the drivetrain of the successful [[Mitsubishi Galant VR-4|Galant VR-4]] rally car.

The Mirage Asti Coupé in Japan was offered as the Lancer Coupé in many export markets.

The Sixth generation Lancer was rebadged as the [[Proton Wira]] sedan and 5-door hatchback models in Malaysia in 1993 with 1.3, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.8 L engine capacities. A short-lived 2.0 L diesel model was also available. Currently, the car has stopped production as one of the longest running [[Proton (company)|Proton]] models in Malaysia after [[Proton Saga]], which is also based on a previous Lancer model. The [[Proton Wira]] was recently replaced by [[Proton (company)|Proton's]] latest model, the [[Proton Persona]].

=== Australia (1992–1996) ===
In Australia, this generation was officially referred to as the CC series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mynrma.com.au/cps/rde/xchg/mynrma/hs.xsl/mitsubishi_lancer_cc_1996_car_review.htm|title=NRMA Car Review - Mitsubishi Lancer CC|publisher=mynrma.com.au|accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sold as a 2-door coupe, as well as a 4-door sedan, wagon and 5-door hatchback (essentially carried over from the previous generation). The GL trim model was the last Lancer to use a [[carburetor]] [[internal combustion engine]]. The rest of the range used an [[electronic fuel injection]] engine. This generation was sold until 1996, when it was replaced by the popular CE series model.

In 1995, the Lancer was renewed for its Seventh generation, building on the earlier model's format. Apart from the Evo models' continuation, it did not depart from the established Lancer formula. A sedan and wagon (Libero in Japan) were offered, with a related Mirage model. The [[coupé]] continued as the Mirage Asti in Japan, known as the Lancer Coupé elsewhere. The 1995 Lancer (Model from 1995-2002 in some countries) is more popularly known as the 1997 Lancer. A turbocharged '''GSR''' version continued to be sold until the end of the 1990s. This platform was also the basis for the Mirage, as it was known in [[North America]] and various other markets.

From 1996 to 2004, the [[Mitsubishi Carisma]] replaced the Mitsubishi Lancer in some markets.

It is of note, that the Lancer Evolution V was the only Lancer Evolution to gain Mitsubishi the [[World Rally Championship|WRC]] constructors championship. However, driver [[Tommi Makinen]] was able to claim four WRC driver's championships for himself, in 1996-1999, driving Mitsubishi's Lancer Evolution III, IV, V &amp; VI.

=== Australia (1996–2004) ===
In [[Australia]], the Seventh sold from 1996-2004. It was designated as the CE series. Like the previous generation, it was available in a variety of body styles, which helped to cater for a more broad audience. The introduction of a sporty MR coupe helped to target this model directly towards a younger audience.

[[File:1999-2001 Mitsubishi Lancer (CE II) GLXi sedan 02.jpg|thumb|left|1999–2001 Mitsubishi Lancer (CE II) GLXi sedan (Australia)]]

The [[station wagon]] continued on as a CE model, even though it was essentially carried over from the previous generation. This model had an unusually long model run, becoming increasingly uncompetitive as the years went by and often heavily discounted by dealers. Towards the end of its model run, Mitsubishi introduced some limited edition models (based on the GLi) to remain competitive with its rivals, these editions featured extras such as sports interiors, alloys and body kits off higher spec models. Generally, this generation sold well throughout its production run.

It should be noted that despite the introduction of the eighth generation Lancer Cedia in 2000, the CE series continued to be sold alongside it until mid-2004. The sedan was available in GLi trim, until it was finally discontinued in 2003. The coupe was facelifted and now only available in GLi and MR trims.

Due to its appearance, affordability, and the rise in status of the Lancer Evolution, this generation was quite popular with young car enthusiasts and the aftermarket modified [[Japan]]ese car scene. Some popular modifications include exhaust systems, suspension, after market stereos and replica Evolution body kits.

[[File:Mitsubishi Lancer -- 07-09-2009.jpg|thumb|left|2002-2003 Mitsubishi Lancer (US)]]

The year 2000 saw the release of the eighth-generation '''Lancer Cedia''' in Japan (meaning Century Diamond); though in most markets the seventh generation Lancer continued, built at Mitsubishi's Mizushima plant in Japan. The new model was available in [[sedan (car)|sedan]] and [[station wagon]] forms. The Mirage, apart from the export models, became a different car in Japan that was unrelated to the Lancer. In Europe, the Lancer was not offered in some countries, being too close to the size of the [[The Netherlands|Dutch]]-built Carisma, so the Evo VII model sold there bore the Carisma name. This is the first generation in many years where the Lancer nameplate is universally used. It is still sold in Japan where the ninth generation Lancer is known as Galant Fortis

In North America, the Lancer Cedia was introduced in 2002 as a direct replacement for the [[Mitsubishi Mirage|Mirage]]. It is powered by a 2.0 L 4G94 engine producing 120&amp;nbsp;hp (92&amp;nbsp;kW) and {{convert|130|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

In Australia, the eighth generation Lancer was introduced as the CG series in July 2002 with the 2.0 L 4G94 engine. It was introduced as a replacement for the seventh generation sedan, and was sold alongside the popular seventh generation coupe.

=== Mid-generation facelift ===
In 2004, a heavily restyled Lancer surfaced with a front [[fascia (car)|facia]] that brought it into line with the Mitsubishi corporate look, as well as a restyled rear, to further differentiate itself from the [[Lancer Evolution]] and for a more modern appearance. The car's grille was then redesigned again in 2006. 

==== North America ====
[[File:06-Mitsubishi-Lancer.jpg|thumb|left|2006 Mitsubishi Lancer ES (U.S.)]]

In North America, additional minor styling changes also occurred for 2005 and 2006. For the 2005 model year, the grille was changed to include more fins to reflect a closer similarity to the North American [[Mitsubishi Galant|Galant]]. For the 2006 model year, the fascia was changed again from a bridged fascia to one with an open vent after Mitsubishi received complaints from current owners regarding its similarity in appearance to General Motors Division [[Pontiac]]'s corporate look, and to bring the appearance closer to its bigger brother, the [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution|Evolution]].

In [[Mexico]], the Lancer was available in DE, ES, LS and GS trims with a 2.0 L DOHC 4G63 engine. There were no estate versions: only the four-door saloon.

==== Ralliart ====
[[File:2004-2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart.jpg|thumb|right|2004-2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart sedan (U.S.)]]

In addition to the facelift, North America received two additional models to the Lancer line in 2004 - Sportback and Ralliart. The latter slated in between the base and high performance Evolution model. Both the Sportback and Ralliart had high levels of equipment, based on the Australian Lancer VR-X. The main difference being that these cars came equipped with Mitsubishi's 2.4 L[[Mitsubishi Sirius engine|4G69]] engine (rated at {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}/{{convert|162|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} for the Sportback, and {{Convert|162|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}/{{convert|162|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} for the Ralliart), included a new, stiffer suspension package that improved handling and lowered the cars stance by 1 centimeter, 16&quot; alloy wheels, front bucket seats borrowed from Japan's Mitsubishi Evolution GT-A, fog lamps, and a new aerodynamic ground package. The Ralliart also came equipped with a cosmetic rear deck spoiler, and clear rear tail lights. The Sportback was equipped with a 4-speed INVECS-II [[automatic transmission]], with no option for a [[manual transmission]], while the Ralliart came with a 5-speed manual transmission with an option for the 4-speed automatic. The Sportback was also available in the lower spec LS trim.

[[File:2006-2008 Mitsubishi Lancer (CH MY07) ES station wagon 03.jpg|thumb|left|2006-2008 Mitsubishi Lancer (CH MY07) ES station wagon (Australia)]]

Due to{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Mitsubishi's deteriorating financial situation and slow sales, the Lancer Sportback wagon was cancelled in the [[United States]] one year after its release. But the Mitsubishi Lancer wagon was sold in [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and was available in at least the latter two until 2009.

==== Australia ====
The 2003 facelift, designated the CH series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_55681/title_CH-Lancer-Prices-Released/newsarticle.html|title=CH Lancer Prices Released|publisher=Autoweb.com.au|accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a heavily updated VR-X, which included new 16&quot; alloys, stiffer suspension, body styling kit, and gear shifter borrowed from the [[Lancer Evolution]]. In 2004, the new Lancer wagon was introduced as a direct replacement for its ageing predecessor.

In August 2005, all Lancers were upgraded to the 2.4 L [[Mitsubishi Sirius engine|4G69]] engine, producing 115&amp;nbsp;kW (154&amp;nbsp;hp) and {{convert|220|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The upgraded engine also saw a change in trim levels and upgraded equipment—the ES and LS models now featured a more upmarket looking black interior, while the VR-X gained a new black grille to closer resemble the [[Lancer Evolution]] IX. The equipment levels of all models were also upgraded, with the LS and VR-X gaining climate control, and a premium audio system sourced from the luxury [[Mitsubishi Verada]]. The Exceed model was discontinued, and all updated models now used JDM sized rear bumpers instead of the larger USDM sized versions. Additionally, the wagon also saw these changes; and as of 2007, continues to be sold alongside the sedan.

The ES and LS models were given a minor facelift for the 2007 model year; this time gaining the same front grille as the US models, and putting it into line with the current corporate look—similar to that of the [[Mitsubishi Colt|Colt]] and the locally built [[Mitsubishi 380|380]]. Prior to the introduction of the all-new ninth generation Lancer, a limited edition ES model dubbed 'Velocity' went on sale. This package included VR-X grill, rear spoiler, leather/alcantara bolsted seats, sports pedals, 15&quot; OZ alloy wheels and chrome exhaust tip—all for the same price as the previous standard ES.

==== Other markets ====
In [[Japan]], the Lancer Cedia was offered with many different trim levels and engines, including options which were never seen in export markets. It was also one of the first models to use the INVECS-III CVT transmission. There was also a Ralliart version of the sportswagon which was powered by a turbocharged 1.8 L GDI engine. As of 2009, the eighth generation Lancer sedan is still being sold alongside the new ninth generation, which is known in the home market as the Galant Fortis.

In [[Pakistan]], this variant was launched in 2005 with cosmetic changes from the front and the back. Thai production was switched to the new model, and in all markets except for [[India]] the seventh-generation model was no longer marketed, four years after the Cedia's introduction. [[India]] received the new Lancer in 2006, known locally as the Mitsubishi Cedia to distinguish it from this version that is still assembled and sold as the Lancer because of its continued popularity. In [[Malaysia]], the Lancer was made available after Mitsubishi had sold all its shares in Malaysian carmaker [[Proton (carmaker)|Proton]], marking the return of Mitsubishi in Malaysian market after being absent since 1985 due to the agreement with Proton. The Lancer sold in Malaysia was powered by the [[Mitsubishi Orion engine|4G18 engine]] which also powered the early 1.6 [[Proton Waja]] model. In the [[Philippines]], the Lancer underwent a facelift, now without the central semi-triangle in the [[grille]]. It is offered in 2 trims, the base GLX with a 5-speed manual and the GLS with an all-new [[INVECS]]-III CVT with manual override. All of them are powered with an l4 1.6L [[Mitsubishi Orion engine|4G18]] SOHC engine.

In some [[Europe]]an markets, the Lancer began to take the place of the Carisma in 2004. It is powered by a 1.3 L SOHC 4G13, 1.6 L SOHC 4G18 engine and a 2.0 L DOHC 4G63 (all 4-cylinder).

In 2005, Mitsubishi revealed the '''Concept-X''' model car at the [[Tokyo Motor Show]] and its '''Concept-Sportback''' model at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show|Frankfurt motor show]]. The new Lancer is based on these two concepts. The new Lancer was officially revealed in January 2007 at the [[Detroit Motor Show]] and went on sale in North American markets on March 2007 as a 2008 model. New Lancer features Mitsubishi's next-generation ''[[Mitsubishi RISE|RISE]]'' safety body.

As per Mitsubishi's heritage of the next generation Lancer this is their ninth generation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.new-lancer.com/en/index.html |title=Mitsubishi New Lancer |publisher=New-lancer.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North America ===
[[File:2010 Mitsubishi Lancer Sportback -- 04-29-2010.jpg|thumb|left|2010 Mitsubishi Lancer Sportback (US)]]
For the [[United States of America|United States]], the new Lancer was initially available in DE, ES, and GTS trim levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/mitsubishi/lancer/2008/|title=2008 Mitsubishi Lancer Review|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; DE, ES, and GTS models are powered by a [[Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance|GEMA]] based [[Mitsubishi 4B1 engine|4B11]], 2.0 liter DOHC engine producing {{Convert|152|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} (except for [[California]] models which have been detuned to {{Convert|143|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} to meet regulations). [[Transmission (mechanics)|Transmission]] options include a brand new [[Continuously Variable Transmission|CVT]], sourced from [[Jatco]] (code: F1CJA), alongside a regular 5-speed manual sourced from [[Aisin Seiki Co.|Aisin AI]] (code: F5MBB). GTS models get a 6-speed paddle shift version of the CVT.

In Canada, a fourth model (SE) was introduced to the Lancer lineup late in the model year. The SE model is a cross between the ES and GTS models. It includes the skirt package similar to the GTS, a rear spoiler, and unlike the GTS model, the SE includes a sunroof. Features not included in the SE model that are found in the GTS are the FAST key, Bluetooth hands-free cell phone interface, automatic climate control, Rockford Fosgate sound system, carbon fiber trim pieces, leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and 18&quot; wheels.

For U.S. markets, starting with the 2009 model year, an ES-Sport version was released similar to the SE model for the Canadian market. Externally the ES-Sport is similar in appaearance to the GTS' skirts, spoiler, mirrors, etc (with the exception of the wheels, the ES-Sport retains the ES wheelset).

The Lancer was released in Australia in October 2007, designated the CJ series and is initially available in ES, VR and VRX trims. The ES included cruise control, driver, passenger and knee airbags, stability and traction control as standard. The VR adds alloy wheels, foglights, side skirts, boot lip spoiler, rain-sensing wipers, automatic headlights, 6-disc CD changer, as well as curtain and side airbags. The VRX gets extra skirts, a larger rear spoiler, 18-inch alloys and a premium Rockford Fosgate sound system. All three models shared the same 4B11 2.0-litre engine and can be had with manual or CVT. A Ralliart version has been introduced later, with a turbocharged version of the same engine, 4WD and paired with a 6-speed twin-clutch gearbox. The Evo X also joins the lineup afterwards. In late 2008, another variant, the Aspire, has been introduced. It includes more luxury features and has a 2.4-litre 4B12 engine mated only to the CVT. The VRX also gets the engine upgrade and can still be had with a manual.

The Sportback body followed the sedan and can be had in ES, VR, VRX and Ralliart trims. Special models have also been introduced, such as the Platinum Edition, which is based on the VR but added a chrome grille and window surrounds (sedan only), MMCS satellite navigation and Bluetooth compatibility for handsfree mobile phone usage. A new RX version is derived from the ES but comes with standard alloy wheels.

=== Asia ===
With the exception of the Lancer Evolution X, the Lancer is marketed as the '''Galant Fortis''' ([[Latin]] for strong, steadfast and courageous) in the [[Japan]]ese domestic market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/04/26/mitsubishi-unveils-design-study-shots-of-the-production-evo-x/|title=Mitsubishi unveils &quot;design study&quot; shots of the production Evo X|publisher=Autoblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comes in 3 trim levels: Exceed, Super Exceed, and Sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/2070823.003/mitsubishi-galant-fortis-launched-ja|title=Mitsubishi Galant Fortis Launched|publisher=World Car Fans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Lancer was released on September 15, 2007 in Taiwan and has been named '''[[:zh-tw:三菱 Mitsubishi Lancer Fortis / iO (台灣版)|Lancer Fortis]]'''. It's powered by a [[Mitsubishi 4B1 engine|4B11]], 2.0 litre DOHC engine outputting {{Convert|157|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and the transmission is a 6-speed (fixed gears in sport mode) version of the CVT. However, unlike other Lancer models in USA and Japan, Mitsubishi has changed the front and rear ends to make it look like a ''family car''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paultan.org/archives/2008/03/19/taiwanese-market-mitsubishi-lancer-fortis/|title=Taiwanese Market Mitsubishi Lancer Fortis|publisher=PaulTan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to popular demand of the 7th-gen Lancer in Singapore, it will continue to be sold alongside the new Lancer which will be called the Lancer '''EX''' to differentiate itself from the former. The 1.5l, 2.0l and the GTS (marketed as the GT) variants are available in Singapore. For MY2009, the GT has been refreshed all around with updated front grill, darkened clear tail lamps, and chrome lining with an additional floor console internally. Rear brakes has also been upgraded for the 2.0 variants to disc brakes for better stopping power.

In Malaysia, only the GTS is offered and is marketed as the GT. However, [[Proton (carmaker)|Proton]] has renewed cross-licensing and technology transfer agreements with Mitsubishi as of October 2008, and it is expected that a second-generation [[Proton Waja]] (currently codenamed the [[Proton New Sedan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gambaran awal Waja Replacement aka Lancer Rebadge!!|work=funtasticko design|date=December 2008|url=http://funtastickodesign.wordpress.com/2010/02/06/gambaran-awal-waja-replacement-aka-lancer-rebadge/|accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) will be a re-badged ninth generation Lancer but with possibly different engine options, and has minor changes, even less than the Lancer Fortis in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROTON ENTERS INTO PRODUCT COLLABORATION WITH MITSUBISHI MOTORS CORPORATION, JAPAN.|work=Bursa Malaysia|date=December 12, 2008|url=http://announcements.bursamalaysia.com/EDMS%5Cannweb.nsf/LsvAllByID/482568AD00295D074825750E0005C2E7?OpenDocument|accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, like Malaysia, only the GTS is sold and is badged as the GT using the new [[Mitsubishi 4B1 engine|2.0L]] engine and is sold alongside the Evolution X, and like Singapore the previous generation Lancer is still sold, marketed as the Lancer Cedia using the same [[Mitsubishi 4G9 engine|1.8L]] engine as the 7th generation Lancer. With the agreement with Proton finalized on October 2008, it is expected that the Lancer-based Waja will be exported to Indonesia.

Hong Kong received its unique edition of the Lancer in 2008, dubbed the Lancer 2.0. The car comes in two trim levels, without a name for either of them. Both are equipped with the [[Mitsubishi 4B1 engine|4B11]] 2.0 4 cylinder engine, 7 airbags, 8 speaker stereo system (manufacturer not known), Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS)  with [[HID]] as well as 18&quot; alloy wheels. The upper trim has Ralliart style body kit which includes a revised front bumper, side skirt, rear bumper with diffuser and the addition of a correct-to-Evolution-X rear spoiler,while the lower trim make do without the abovementioned features.

In Philippines the Lancer arrived in Mid 2008 known as the Lancer EX to differentiate it from the 7th-generation Lancer still sold in the Philippines. For the 2010 MY, the Lancer EX underwent a facelift, and is now available with 4 trims, the Ralliart paired to the 6-speed TC-SST, which is essentially the Lancer Ralliart from the USDM, the GT-A, now with a redesigned front grille resembling the Lancer Ralliart from the USDM, the GT, essentially identical to the GT-A but is paired to a 5-speed manual, the GLS which is essentially identical to the USDM ES model but with dual SRS airbags and standard front foglamps, and the GLX, which is essentially identical to the USDM DE, but with the same rims as with that of the GLS and with dual SRS airbags. All models sport clear-type black taillamps, ABS, EBD and share the same 2.0L 4B11 MIVEC powerplant, with the Ralliart's engine similar to the USDM Ralliart.

=== Chile ===
To differentiate it from the previous model, still on sale, this generation Lancer is marketed as '''Lancer Serie R''' in Chile.

=== El Salvador ===
Because the previous generation is still on sale, this generation Lancer is marketed, depending on the engine and trim, as '''Lancer EX''' or '''Lancer GT''' in El Salvador.

=== Europe ===
In Europe, a 103 kW (140 PS; 138 bhp) 2000 cc diesel model is also available which is built by [[List of Volkswagen Group diesel engines#2.0 TDI PD 100-125kW|Volkswagen]].

=== Lancer Ralliart ===
A detuned and cheaper version of the Evo X was announced at the 2008 [[Detroit auto show]]. This model became available for purchase in the United States in October, 2008. {{Convert|177|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|343|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} of torque.

For 2009, the Ralliart is available exclusively with the TC-SST transmission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/mitsubishi/lancer/2009/specs/|title=2009 Mitsubishi Lancer Specs|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Mitsubishi has suggested the possibility of a 5-speed transmission at a later date. The TC-SST transmission equipped in the Ralliart offers 2 modes (Normal, Sport) rather than the 3 modes the same transmission offers in the Lancer Evolution X MR (Normal, Sport, S-Sport). The car also includes a simplified version of the Evolution X's AWD system (taken directly from the EVO IX), with a simple &quot;mechanical limited slip&quot; rear differential.&lt;ref name=&quot;lancer_ralliart&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=124308|title=2008 Detroit Auto Show: 2009 Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart|publisher=Edmunds}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Edmunds.com]] the Ralliart model underperformed the GTS in certain tests, including the [[skidpad]], [[Zigzag|slalom]], and [[braking distance]]. However, the Ralliart outperformed the GTS in other tests, including [[0-60]] and the [[quarter mile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FullTests/articleId=127586|title=Testing the 'Tweener'|publisher=Inside Line|accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New York''' ({{IPAc-en|n|juː|_|ˈ|j|ɔr|k}}; locally {{IPA2|nɪu&amp;nbsp;ˈjoək|}} or {{IPA2|nuː&amp;nbsp;ˈjɔrk||en-us-New York.ogg}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] regions of the [[United States]] and is the nation's [[List of U.S. states by population|third most populous]]. The state is bordered by [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]] to the south, and [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[Vermont]] to the east. The state has a maritime border with [[Rhode Island]] east of [[Long Island]], as well as an [[Canada – United States border|international border]] with the [[Canada|Canadian]] provinces of [[Ontario]] to the west, and [[Quebec]] to the north. New York is often referred to as '''New York State''' to distinguish it from [[New York City]].

New York City, which is geographically the largest city in the state and most populous in the United States, is known for its history as a [[Ellis Island|gateway for immigration]] to the United States and its status as a financial, cultural, transportation, and manufacturing center. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it is also a destination of choice for many foreign visitors. Both state and city were named for the 17th century [[Duke of York]], James Stuart, future [[James II of England|James II and VII]] of [[England]] and [[Scotland]].

New York was inhabited by the [[Algonquin]], [[Iroquois]], and [[Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups at the time [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[French people|French]] nationals moved into the region in the early 17th century. First claimed by [[Henry Hudson]] in 1609, the region came to have Dutch [[fort]]s at [[Fort Orange]], near the site of the present-day [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in 1614. The Dutch colonized the Albany and [[Manhattan]] areas in 1624.  The [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] took over Manhattan and the colony by annexation in 1664.

The borders of the British colony, the [[Province of New York]], were roughly similar to those of the present-day state. About one third of all of the battles of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] took place in New York. New York became an independent state on July 9, 1776, and enacted its [[New York State Constitutions|constitution]] in 1777. The state ratified the [[United States Constitution]] on July 26, 1788 to become the 11th state.

New York covers {{convert|54556|mi2|km2|abbr=off}} and ranks as the 27th largest state by size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108355.html |title=Land and Water Area of States (2000) |publisher=Infoplease.com |accessdate=2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Appalachian Valley]] dominates eastern New York, while [[Lake Champlain]] is the chief northern feature of the valley, which also includes the [[Hudson River]] flowing southward to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The rugged [[Adirondack Mountains]], with vast tracts of wilderness, lie west of the valley. 

Most of the southern part of the state is on the [[Allegheny Plateau]], which rises from the southeast to the [[Catskill Mountains]]. The western section of the state is drained by the [[Allegheny River]] and rivers of the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and [[Delaware River|Delaware]] systems. The Delaware River Basin Compact, signed in 1961 by New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and the federal government, regulates the utilization of water of the Delaware system. The highest elevation in New York is [[Mount Marcy]] in the Adirondacks.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

New York's borders touch (clockwise from the west) two Great Lakes ([[Lake Erie|Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario|Ontario]], which are connected by the [[Niagara River]]); the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] in Canada; [[Lake Champlain]]; three [[New England]] states ([[Vermont]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Connecticut]]); the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and two [[Mid-Atlantic States]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. In addition, [[Rhode Island]] shares a water border with New York.

In contrast with [[New York City]]'s urban atmosphere, the vast majority of the state is dominated by farms, forests, rivers, mountains, and lakes. New York's [[Adirondack Park]] is the largest state park in the United States. It is larger than the Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Glacier and Olympic National Parks combined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.state.ny.us/About_Park/index.html About the Adirondack Park], Adirondack Park Agency. Accessed July 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; New York established the first state park in the United States at Niagara Falls in 1885. [[Niagara Falls]], on the Niagara River as it flows from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, is a popular attraction. 

The [[Hudson River]] begins with [[Lake Tear of the Clouds]] and flows south through the eastern part of the state without draining Lakes [[Lake George (New York)|George]] or [[Lake Champlain|Champlain]]. Lake George empties at its north end into Lake Champlain, whose northern end extends into Canada, where it drains into the [[Richelieu River|Richelieu]] and then the [[St. Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] Rivers. Four of New York City's [[five boroughs]] are on the three islands at the mouth of the Hudson River: [[Manhattan Island]], [[Staten Island, New York|Staten Island]], and [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]] on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]].

[[Upstate New York|''Upstate'']] and [[Downstate New York|''downstate'']] are often used informally to distinguish New York City or its greater metropolitan area from the rest of New York state. The placement of a boundary between the two is a matter of great contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of New York}}
[[File:LakeEffectSnowBuffalo101206.gif|thumb|right|250px|[[Lake-effect snow]] is a major contributor to snowfall totals in western New York.]]
In general, New York has a [[humid continental climate]], though under the [[Köppen climate classification]], New York City has a [[humid subtropical climate]].&lt;ref name=NYClimate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nysc.eas.cornell.edu/climate_of_ny.html|title=Climate of New York|publisher=New York State Climate Office - Cornell University|accessdate=April 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weather in New York is heavily influenced by two continental air masses: a warm, humid one from the southwest and a cold, dry one from the northwest.

The winters are long and cold in the Plateau Divisions of the state. In the majority of winter seasons, a temperature of {{convert|-13|F|C|0}} or lower can be expected in the northern highlands (Northern Plateau) and {{convert|5|F|C|0}} or colder in the southwestern and east-central highlands (Southern Plateau). The summer climate is cool in the Adirondacks, Catskills and higher elevations of the Southern Plateau.

The New York City/Long Island area and lower portions of the [[Hudson Valley]] have rather warm summers by comparison, with some periods of high, uncomfortable humidity. The remainder of New York State enjoys pleasantly warm summers, marred by only occasional, brief intervals of sultry conditions.

[[File:Adirondack and Catskill Parks Locator.svg|thumb|right|Two major parks in the state are the [[Adirondack Park]] and [[Catskill Park]].]]

New York has many state parks and two major forest preserves. [[Adirondack Park]], roughly the size of the state of [[Vermont]] and the largest state park in the United States, was established in 1892 and given state constitutional protection in 1894. The thinking that led to the creation of the Park first appeared in [[George Perkins Marsh]]'s ''[[Man and Nature]]'', published in 1864. Marsh argued that deforestation could lead to desertification; referring to the clearing of once-lush lands surrounding the Mediterranean, he asserted &quot;the operation of causes set in action by man has brought the face of the earth to a desolation almost as complete as that of the moon.&quot;

The [[Catskill Park]] was protected in legislation passed in 1885,&lt;ref name=CatskillPark1&gt;{{cite web |year= |url=http://www.catskillpark.org/history/history.htm|title=Catskill Park History |publisher=www.catskillpark.org |accessdate=April 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which declared that its land was to be conserved and never put up for sale or lease. Consisting of {{convert|700000|acre|km2}} of land,&lt;ref name=CatskillPark1/&gt; the park is a habitat for bobcats, minks and fishers. There are some 400 black bears living in the region. The state operates numerous campgrounds and there are over {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=off}} of multi-use trails in the Park.

The [[Montauk Point State Park]] boasts the famous [[Montauk Lighthouse]], commissioned by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]], which is a major tourist attraction and is located in the township of [[East Hampton (town)|East Hampton]], [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]]. [[Hither Hills State Park|Hither Hills]] park offers camping and is a popular destination with surfcasting sport fishermen.

{{Main|History of New York}}
[[File:NewYork1777MapRestoredSmall.png|thumb|New York in 1777]]

=== 17th century ===
During the 17th century, Dutch [[trading post]]s established for the trade of pelts from the [[Lenape]], [[Iroquois]] and other [[indigenous people]]s expanded into the colony of [[New Netherlands]]. The first of these trading posts were [[Fort Nassau (North)|Fort Nassau]] (1614, near present-day [[Albany, New York|Albany]]); [[Fort Orange]] (1624, on the [[Hudson River]] just south of the current city of Albany and created to replace [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]]), developing into settlement [[Beverwijck]] (1647), and into what became Albany; [[Fort Amsterdam]] (1625, to develop into the town [[New Amsterdam]] which is present-day [[New York City]]); and Esopus, (1653, now [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]]). The success of the [[patroonship]] of [[Rensselaerswyck]] (1630), which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid 19th century, was also a key factor in the early success of the colony.  The British captured the colony during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] and governed it as the [[Province of New York]].

=== American Revolution ===

The [[Sons of Liberty]] were organized in New York City during the 1760s, largely in response to the oppressive [[Stamp Act]] passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] in 1765.  The [[Stamp Act Congress]] met in the city on October 19 of that year: a gathering of representatives from across the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that set the stage for the [[Continental Congress]] to follow.  The Stamp Act Congress resulted in the [[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]], which was the first written expression by representatives of the Americans of many of the rights and complaints later expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], including the right to [[No taxation without representation|representative government]].

The [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga]] provided the [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|cannon and gunpowder]] necessary to force a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] withdrawal from the [[Siege of Boston]] in 1775.

New York endorsed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on July 9, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= |url=http://www.history.com/minisites/fourthofjuly/viewPage?pageId=690 |title=Declaration of Independence |publisher=www.history.com |accessdate=April 10, 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080409165028/http%3A//www.history.com/minisites/fourthofjuly/viewPage%3FpageId%3D690 |archivedate = April 09, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York state constitution was framed by a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|convention]] which assembled at [[White Plains, New York]] on July 10, 1776, and after repeated adjournments and changes of location, terminated its labors at [[Kingston, New York]] on Sunday evening, April 20, 1777, when the [[Constitution of New York, 1777|new constitution]] drafted by [[John Jay]] was adopted with but one dissenting vote. It was not submitted to the people for ratification. On July 30, 1777, [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] was inaugurated as the first [[Governor of New York]] at Kingston.

The first major battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]] after independence was declared – and the largest battle of the entire war – was fought in New York at the [[Battle of Long Island]] (a.k.a ''Battle of Brooklyn'') in August of 1776. British victory made New York City their military and political base of operations in North America for the duration of the conflict, and consequently the center of attention for General [[George Washington]]'s [[Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]].

The notorious British [[prison ships]] of [[Wallabout Bay]] saw more American combatants [[HMS Jersey (1736)|die of intentional neglect]] than were killed in combat in every battle of the war, combined.

The first of two major British armies were captured by the [[Continental Army]] at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777, influencing France to ally with the revolutionaries.

Four of the [[Iroquois]] nations fought on the side of the British; only the Onondagas were allies of the colonists. Many Iroquois were defeated in the [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1779.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= |url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/ppet/sullivan/page1.asp?secid=31 |title=The Sullivan and Brodhead Expeditions |publisher=Pennsylvania Museum and Historical Commission |accessdate=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Loyalist allies of the losing British, the Iroquois were pushed to Canada after the war. In the treaty settlement, the British ceded most Indian lands to the new United States. Because New York made treaty with the Iroquois without getting Congressional approval, some of the land purchases are the subject of modern-day claims by the individual tribes. More than 5 million acres of former Iroquois territory was put up for sale in the years after the Revolutionary War, leading to rapid development in upstate New York.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, David W. ''Battle Over Iroquois Land Claims Escalates'' [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DF1E3BF935A25756C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=3] The New York Times. May 16, 2000. (accessed April 11, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  As per the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the last vestige of British authority in the former [[Thirteen Colonies]] – their troops in New York City – departed in 1783, which was long afterwards celebrated as [[Evacuation Day (New York)|Evacuation Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_newsroom/daily_plants/daily_plant_main.php?id=19733 |title=Happy Evacuation Day |publisher=New York City Department of Parks and Recreation |accessdate=April 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following heated debate, which included the publication of the now quintessential constitutional interpretation - the [[Federalist Papers]] - as a series of installments in New York City newspapers, New York was the 11th state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]], on July 26, 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/rat_ny.html|title=New York's Ratification |publisher=The U.S. Constitution Online |accessdate=April 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th century ===
[[File:BaldwinsvilleLock24.jpg|thumb|right|The creation of the [[Erie Canal]] led to rapid industrialization in New York.]]
Transportation in western New York was difficult before canals were built in the early part of the nineteenth century. The [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]] Rivers could be navigated only as far as Central New York. While the [[St. Lawrence River]] could be navigated to [[Lake Ontario]], the way westward to the other [[Great Lakes]] was blocked by [[Niagara Falls]], and so the only route to western New York was over land.

Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] strongly advocated building a canal to connect the Hudson River with [[Lake Erie]], and thus all the [[Great Lakes]]. Work commenced in 1817, and the [[Erie Canal]] was finished in 1825. It was considered an engineering marvel. Packet boats traveled up and down the canal with sightseers and visitors on board.&lt;ref name=ErieCanal&gt;{{cite web |year= |url=http://www.nyscanals.gov/cculture/history/|title=The Erie Canal: A Brief History |publisher=New York State Canals |accessdate=April 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The canal opened up vast areas of New York to commerce and settlement. It enabled Great Lakes port cities such as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] to grow and prosper. It also connected the burgeoning agricultural production of the Midwest and shipping on the Great Lakes, with the port of New York City. Improving transportation, it enabled additional population migration to territories west of New York.

=== Ellis Island ===
{{Main|Ellis Island}}

[[File:Ellis Island immigration footage.ogg|thumb|right|Scenes at the Immigration Depot and a nearby dock on [[Ellis Island]]]]
[[File:Ellis Island in 1905.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ellis Island]] in 1905]]

Ellis Island was the main facility for [[immigrants]], entering the [[United States]] in the late 19th Century to the mid 20th Century. The facility operated from January 1, 1892, until November 12, 1954. It is owned by the Federal government and is now part of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]], under the jurisdiction of the [[National Park Service]]. It is situated in [[New York Harbor]], between two states and cities, [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]] and [[New York City]], New York.

More than 12 million immigrants passed through [[Ellis Island]], between 1892 and 1954. After 1924, when the [[National Origins Act]] was passed, the only immigrants to pass through there were displaced persons or war refugees.&lt;ref&gt;''The Brown Quarterly'', [http://brownvboard.org/brwnqurt/04-1/04-1a.htm Volume 4, No. 1 (Fall 2000) – Ellis Island/Immigration Issue]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, over 100 million Americans can trace their ancestry to the immigrants, who first arrived in America through the island, before dispersing to points all over the country. Ellis Island was the subject of a border dispute between New York State and New Jersey.

=== Statue of Liberty ===
{{Main|Statue of Liberty}}
[[File:Statue of Liberty, NY.jpg|thumb|[[Statue of Liberty]]]]

The Statue of Liberty was a gift from France to the United States to mark the Centennial of the American Declaration of Independence. The idea of giving a colossal representation of republican virtues to a &quot;sister&quot; republic, across the sea, served as a focus for the republican cause against other politicians. The Statue of Liberty was dedicated in New York Harbor on October 28, 1886.

[[Liberty Island]] closed on [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]]; the island reopened in December, the monument reopened on August 3, 2004, but the statue remained closed until the summer of 2009. The National Park Service claims that the statue is not shut because of a terrorist threat, but principally because of a long list of fire regulation contraventions, including inadequate evacuation procedures. The museum and ten-story pedestal are open for visitors, but are only accessible if visitors have a &quot;Monument Access Pass&quot;, which is a reservation that visitors must make in advance of their visit and pick up before boarding the ferry. There are a maximum of 3000 passes available each day, with a total of 15,000 visitors to the island daily. The interior of the statue remains closed, although a glass ceiling in the pedestal allows for views of [[Gustave Eiffel]]'s iron framework of Lady Liberty.

=== Population ===
[[File:New York Population Map.png|thumb|left|New York population density map]]

As of 2006, New York was the third largest state in population after California and Texas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2006/statepopest_table1.xls |title=Estimates of Population Change for the United States and States, and for Puerto Rico and State Rankings: July 1, 2005 to July 1, 2006 |accessdate=2007-01-05 |format= Excel Spreadsheet |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070311040559/http%3A//www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2006/statepopest_table1.xls |archivedate = March 11, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated population of 19,541,453 as of July 1, 2009.&lt;ref name=09CenEst/&gt; This represents an increase of 513,481, or 2.7%, since the last census in 2000.&lt;ref name=census_cum&gt;{{cite web |title=Cumulative Estimates of the Components of Population Change for the United States, Regions and States: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2008 (NST-EST2008-04) |url=http://www.census.gov/popest/states/tables/NST-EST2008-04.csv |author=U. S. Census Bureau |authorlink=United States Census Bureau |date=2008-12-15 |accessdate=2009-01-16 |format=CSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a natural increase since the last census of 803,680 people (that is 2,072,765 births minus 1,269,085 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 698,895 people out of the state.&lt;ref name=census_cum/&gt; [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 876,969 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 1,575,864 people.&lt;ref name=census_cum/&gt;

In spite of the open land in the state, New York's population is very urban, with 92% of residents living in an urban area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ers.usda.gov/StateFacts/NY.htm New York Fact Sheet: NY agriculture income population food education employment farms top commodities exports counties financial indicators poverty organic farming farm income America USDA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

New York is a slow growing state with a large rate of domestic migration to other states. In 2000 and 2005, more people moved from New York to Florida than from any one state to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/State_Migration_Flows_Paper.doc|title=Domestic Migration Flows for States from the 2005 ACS|accessdate=2007-10-19|format=Microsoft Word}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, New York state is one of the leading destinations for international immigration and thus has the second largest immigrant population in the country (after California) at 4.2 million as of 2008. Although [[Upstate New York]] receives considerable immigration, most of the state's immigrants settle in and around New York City, due to its more vibrant economy and cosmopolitan culture.

The [[center of population]] of New York is located in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], in the town of [[Deerpark, New York|Deerpark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt|title= Population and Population Centers by State: 2000|accessdate=2007-01-05 |format= Text }}&lt;/ref&gt; New York City and its eight suburban counties (excluding those in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania) have a combined population of 13,209,006 people, or 68.42% of the state's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?-geo_id=04000US36&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_DP3&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U

=== Racial and ancestral makeup ===
[[File:Ancestry-new-york-by county-2000.PNG|thumb|left|New York population ethnicity map]]
The major ancestry groups in New York state are [[United States|African American]] (15.8%), [[Italian-American|Italian]] (14.4%), [[Irish-American|Irish]] (12.9%), and [[German-American|German]] (11.1%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://awesomeamerica.com/newyork/ Awesome America: New York]. RetrieveAugust d 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2004 estimate, 20.4% of the population is foreign-born.

New York is home to the [[List of U.S. states by African-American population|largest African American]] population and the [[List of U.S. states by Asian American population|second largest Asian American]] population in the United States. In addition it is home to the largest [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], [[Dominican American|Dominican]] and [[Jamaican American]] populations in the continental United States. The New York City neighborhood of [[Harlem]] has historically been a major cultural capital for African-Americans of sub-Saharan descent, and [[Bedford Stuyvesant]] is the largest such population in the United States.

[[Queens]], also in New York City, is home to the state's largest [[Asian-American]] population, and is also the most diverse county in the United States. The second concentration of Asian-Americans is in Manhattan's Chinatown. [[Queens]] is home to the largest [[Andes|Andean]] population ([[Colombian American|Colombian]], [[Ecuadorian American|Ecuadorian]], [[Peruvian American|Peruvian]] and [[Bolivian American|Bolivian]]) population in [[The United States]] of America.

In the 2000 Census, [[Italian Americans]] made up the largest ancestral group in Staten Island and Long Island, followed by [[Irish Americans]]. Albany and southeast-central New York also have populations with many of Irish-American and Italian-American descent. In Buffalo and western New York, [[German Americans]] are the largest group; in the northern tip of the state, [[French Canadians]] are. New York State has a higher number of Italian Americans than any other U.S. state.

6.5% of New York's population were under 5 years of age, 24.7% under 18, and 12.9% were 65 or older. Females made up 51.8% of the population.

According to the [[2000 U.S. Census]], 13.61% of the population aged 5 and over speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at home, while 2.04% speak [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (including [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), 1.65% [[Italian language|Italian]], and 1.23% [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&amp;state_id=36&amp;mode=state_tops&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
[[Roman Catholicism in the United States|Catholics]] comprise more than 40% of the population in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm

The smallest city is [[Sherrill, New York]], located just west of the [[Vernon (town), New York|Town of Vernon]] in [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]]. [[Albany, New York|Albany]] is the state capital, and the [[Town of Hempstead, New York|Town of Hempstead]] is the civil township with the largest population. If it were a city, it would be the second largest in the state with over 700,000 residents.

The southern tip of New York State—[[Geography and environment of New York City|New York City]], its suburbs including [[Long Island]], the southern portion of the Hudson Valley, and most of northern [[New Jersey]]—can be considered to form the central core of the [[Northeast megalopolis]]&quot;, a super-city stretching from the northern suburbs of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] south to the [[Virginia]] suburbs of [[Washington D.C.]].

New York's gross state product in 2007 was $1.1 trillion, ranking third in size behind the larger states of California and Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;bureaueconomic&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by State, 2005|author=The Bureau of Economic Analysis|date=2006-08-26|url=http://www.bea.gov/bea/newsrel/gspnewsrelease.htm|accessdate=2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; If New York were an independent nation, it would rank as the 16th largest economy in the world behind [[Turkey]]. Its 2007 [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita (nominal)|per capita personal income]] was $46,364, placing it sixth in the nation behind Maryland, and eighth in the world behind [[Ireland]]. New York's [[agriculture|agricultural]] outputs are [[dairy]] products, [[cattle]] and other [[livestock]], [[vegetable]]s, [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] stock, and [[apples]]. Its industrial outputs are printing and [[publishing]], scientific instruments, electric equipment, [[machinery]], [[chemical]] products, and [[tourism]].

A recent review by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found 13 states, including several of the nation's largest, face budget shortfalls for FY2009. New York faces a [[deficit]] that could be as large as $4.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbpp.org/12-18-07sfp.htm 13 States Face Total Budget Shortfall of at Least $23 Billion in 2009; 11 Others Expect Budget Problems, 12/18/07], Center on Budget and Policy Priorities&lt;/ref&gt;

New York exports a wide variety of goods such as foodstuffs, commodities, minerals, computers and electronics, cut diamonds, and automobile parts. In 2007, the state exported a total of $71.1 billion worth of goods, with the five largest foreign export markets being Canada ($15 billion), United Kingdom ($6 billion), Switzerland ($5.9 billion), Israel ($4.9 billion), and Hong Kong ($3.4 billion). New York's largest imports are oil, gold, aluminum, natural gas, electricity, rough diamonds, and lumber.

Canada is a very important economic partner for the state. 21% of the state's total worldwide exports went to Canada in 2007. Tourism from the north is also a large part of the economy. Canadians spent US$487 million in 2004 while visiting the state.

New York City is the leading center of [[banking]], [[finance]] and [[mass media|communication]] in the United States and is the location of the [[New York Stock Exchange]], the largest stock exchange in the world by dollar volume. Many of the world's largest corporations are based in the city.

The state also has a large manufacturing sector that includes printing and the production of garments, furs, railroad equipment and bus line vehicles. Many of these industries are concentrated in upstate regions. Albany and the Hudson Valley are major centers of nanotechnology and microchip manufacturing, while the [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester]] area is important in photographic equipment and imaging.

New York is a major agricultural producer, ranking among the top five states for agricultural products such as dairy, apples, cherries, cabbage, potatoes, onions, maple syrup and many others. The state is the largest producer of cabbage in the U.S. The state has about a quarter of its land in farms and produced US$3.4 billion in agricultural products in 2001. The south shore of Lake Ontario provides the right mix of [[soil]]s and [[microclimate]] for many apple, cherry, [[plum]], [[pear]] and [[peach]] [[orchard]]s. Apples are also grown in the Hudson Valley and near Lake Champlain.

New York is the nation's third-largest grape-producing state, behind California, and second-largest wine producer by volume. The south shore of Lake Erie and the southern [[Finger Lakes]] hillsides have many vineyards. In addition, the [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York|North Fork]] of [[Long Island]] developed vineyards, production and visitors' facilities in the last three decades of the 20th century. In 2004, New York's wine and grape industry brought US$6 billion into the state economy.

The state has {{convert|30000|acre|km2}} of vineyards, 212 wineries, and produced 200 million bottles of wine in 2004. A moderately sized saltwater commercial fishery is located along the Atlantic side of Long Island. The principal catches by value are clams, lobsters, squid, and flounder. These areas of the economy have been increasing as environmental protection has led to an increase in ocean wildlife.

As of January 2010, the state's unemployment rate was 8.8%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/lau/ Bls.gov]; Local Area Unemployment Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NYCSub 7 Vernon Jackson 3.jpg|thumb|right|The [[New York City Subway]] serves more than 5 million rides on a given week day]]
New York has one of the most extensive and one of the oldest transportation infrastructures in the country. Engineering difficulties because of the terrain of the state and the unique issues of the city brought on by urban crowding have had to be overcome since the state was young. Population expansion of the state generally followed the path of the early waterways, first the [[Hudson River]] and then the [[Erie Canal]]. Today, railroad lines and the [[New York State Thruway]] follow the same general route. The [[New York State Department of Transportation]] is often criticized for how they maintain the roads of the state in certain areas and for the fact that the tolls collected along the roadway have long passed their original purpose. Until 2006, tolls were collected on the Thruway within [[Buffalo, New York|The City of Buffalo]]. They were dropped late in 2006 during the campaign for Governor (both candidates called for their removal).

In addition to New York City's famous [[New York City Subway|mass transit subway]], four suburban commuter railroad systems enter and leave the city: the [[Long Island Rail Road]], [[Metro-North Railroad]], [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson]], and five of [[New Jersey Transit Rail Operations|New Jersey Transit's rail lines]]. Many other cities have urban and regional public transportation. In Buffalo, the [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]] runs the [[Buffalo Metro Rail]] light-rail system; in Rochester, the [[Rochester Subway]] operated from 1927 until 1956 but has fallen into disuse.

[[File:New York State current license plate from 2001.jpg|thumb|left|The former designated-number license plate for vehicles registered in New York State, introduced in 2001 and ended on April 1, 2010.]]

The [[New York State Department of Motor Vehicles]] (NYSDMV or DMV) is the governmental agency responsible for registering and inspecting automobiles and other motor vehicles as well as licensing drivers in the U.S. state of New York. As of 2008, the NYSDMV has 11,284,546 drivers licenses on file&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydmv.state.ny.us/Statistics/statli08.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and 10,697,644 vehicle registrations in force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydmv.state.ny.us/Statistics/regin08.htm&lt;/ref&gt; All gasoline powered vehicles registered in New York State must get an emissions inspection every 12 months. Diesel powered vehicles with a Gross Weight Rating over 8 500&amp;nbsp;lbs that are registered in the NY Metropolitan Area must get an annual emissions inspection. All vehicles registered in NYS must get an annual safety inspection.

Portions of the transportation system are [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]], allowing travelers to easily switch from one mode of transportation to another. One of the most notable examples is [[AirTrain JFK]] which allows rail passengers to travel directly to terminals at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]].

In May 2009 the [[New York City Department of Transportation]] under the control of Transportation Commissioner [[Janette Sadik-Khan]] banned cars from [[Times Square]]. The move designed to reduce [[pollution]] and pedestrian accidents looks likely to be implemented permantly, and will last at least until the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1187300/New-York-celebrates-new-era-cars-banished-Times-Square.html|accessdate=2009-05-25|publisher=MailOnline|title=New York celebrates new era as cars are banished from Times Square}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

== Politics and government ==
{{Main|Government of New York}}

[[File:NYSCapitolPanorama.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[New York State Capitol]] building in [[Albany, New York|Albany]].]]
Under its present [[New York State Constitutions|constitution]] (adopted in 1938), New York is governed by the same three branches that govern all fifty states of the United States: the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]], consisting of the [[Governor of New York]] and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the [[legislative branch]], consisting of the [[bicameral]] [[New York State Legislature]]; and the [[judicial branch]], consisting of the state's highest court, the [[New York Court of Appeals]], and lower courts. The state has two U.S. senators, 29 members in the [[United States House of Representatives]], and 31 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] in national presidential elections (a drop from its 47 votes during the 1940s).

New York's capital is [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. The state's subordinate political units are its 62 [[county|counties]]. Other officially incorporated governmental units are [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|towns]], [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|cities]], and [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|villages]]. New York has more than 4,200 local governments that take one of these forms. About 52% of all revenue raised by local governments in the state is raised solely by the [[government of New York City]], which is the largest municipal government in the United States, whereas New York City houses only 42% of the state population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2006 Annual Report on Local Governments|author=Office of the New York State Comptroller|date=2006-11|url=http://www.osc.state.ny.us/localgov/datanstat/annreport/06annreport.pdf|accessdate=2006-11-14|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has a strong imbalance of payments with the federal government. New York State receives 82 cents in services for every $1 it sends in taxes to the federal government in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Fair Share State Budget: Does Albany Play Fair with NYC?|author=New York City Finance Division|date=2005-03-11|url=http://webdocs.nyccouncil.info/attachments/65379.htm?CFID=232457&amp;CFTOKEN=33008944|accessdate=2006-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state ranks near the bottom, in 42nd place, in federal spending per tax dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/show/266.html |title=Federal Spending in Each State Per Dollar of Federal Taxes FY2005 |publisher=Tax Foundation |accessdate=April 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of New York's public services are carried out by [[public benefit corporations]], frequently called ''authorities'' or ''development corporations''. Well known [[New York public benefit corporations|public benefit corporations in New York]] include the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York)|Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], which oversees New York City's public transportation system, and the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], a bi-state transportation infrastructure agency.

New York's legal system is explicitly based upon [[English common Law]].

New York has 31 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] in national presidential elections (a drop from its 47 votes during the 1940s).

New York is represented by [[Chuck Schumer]] and [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] in the [[United States Senate]] and has 29 representatives to the [[United States House of Representatives]], behind [[California]]'s 53 congressional districts and [[Texas]]' 32 congressional districts.

=== Capital punishment ===
{{Main|Capital punishment in New York}}

[[Capital punishment in the United States|Capital punishment]] was reintroduced in 1995 under the [[George Pataki#Death penalty|Pataki administration]] but the statute was declared unconstitutional in 2004, when the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in ''[[People v. LaValle]]'' that it violated the [[New York Constitution|state constitution]]. The remaining death sentence was commuted by the court to [[life imprisonment]] in 2007, in ''People v. John Taylor'', and the death row was disestablished in 2008, under executive order from [[David Paterson|Governor Paterson]]. No execution has taken place in New York since 1963. Legislative efforts to amend the statute have failed, and death sentences are no longer sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/execution/NEW%20YORK.htm|title=New York Executions|date=2005-10-25|accessdate=2009-04-09|author=Rob Gallagher|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080528081537/http%3A//users.bestweb.net/%7Erg/execution/NEW%2520YORK.htm |archivedate = May 28, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/07242008/news/regionalnews/gov_pulls_switch_on_death_cell_121295.htm|title=GOV PULLS SWITCH ON DEATH CELL|date=2008-07-24|publisher=[[New York Post]]|author=Scott, Brendan|accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Powell, Michael|title=In N.Y., Lawmakers Vote Not to Reinstate Capital Punishment|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47871-2005Apr12.html|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2005-04-13|accessdate=2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
[[File:David Paterson 2 by David Shankbone (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[David Paterson]] [[United States Democratic Party|(D)]] is the current [[Governor of New York]].]]
{{Main|Politics of New York|Elections in New York|Political party strength in New York|New York's congressional districts}}

In the last few decades, New York State has generally supported candidates belonging to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in national elections. Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] won New York State by 25 percentage points in 2008, a bigger margin than [[John Kerry]] in 2004. [[New York City]] is a major Democratic stronghold with liberal politics. Many of the state's other urban areas, such as [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] are also Democratic. Rural upstate New York, however, is generally more conservative than the cities and tends to favor [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. Heavily populated Suburban areas such as [[Westchester County]] and [[Long Island]] have swung between the major parties over the past 25 years, but more often than not support Democrats.

New York City is the most important source of political fund-raising in the United States for both major parties. Four of the top five zip codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan. The top zip code, 10021 on the [[Upper East Side]], generated the most money for the 2000 presidential campaigns of both [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2006 Election Overview: Top Zip codes|author=Opensecrets.org|date=2005-05-16|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/topzips.asp?cycle=2004|accessdate=2006-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in New York}}
[[File:SUNYAdminBuildingAlbany.jpg|thumb|[[SUNY System Administration Building|System Administration Building]] of the [[State University of New York]] in [[Albany, New York|Albany]]]]
The [[University of the State of New York]] oversees all public primary, middle-level, and secondary education in the state, while the [[New York City Department of Education]] manages the public school system in New York City.

At the college level, the statewide public university system is the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY). The [[City University of New York]] (CUNY) is the public university system of New York City. The SUNY system consists of 64 community colleges, technical colleges, undergraduate colleges and universities. The four university centers are [[University at Albany]], [[Binghamton University]], [[University at Buffalo]] and [[SUNY Stony Brook]].

In addition there are many notable private universities, including the oldest [[Catholic]] institution in the northeast, [[Fordham University]]. New York is home to both [[Columbia University]] and [[Cornell University]], making it the only state to contain more than one [[Ivy League]] school.  [[West Point]], the service academy of the [[U.S. Army]] is located just south of [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], NY on the banks of the [[Hudson River]].

== Sports ==
{{Main|Sports in New York}}
New York hosted the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] at [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], the Games known for the USA-USSR hockey game dubbed the &quot;[[Miracle on Ice]]&quot; in which a group of American college students and amateurs defeated the heavily favored Soviet national ice hockey team 4–3 and went on to win the gold medal against [[Finland]].  Lake Placid also hosted the [[1932 Winter Olympics]]. Along with [[St. Moritz, Switzerland]] and [[Innsbruck, Austria]], it is one of the three places to have twice hosted the Winter Olympic Games.

New York is the home of one [[National Football League]] team, the [[Buffalo Bills]], (based in the suburb of [[Orchard Park (town), New York|Orchard Park]]). Although the [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]] represent the [[New York metropolitan area]] and were previously located in New York City, they play in [[Meadowlands Stadium]], which is located in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|East Rutherford]], [[New Jersey]]. The Meadowlands stadium will host [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] in 2014. There has been much controversy over the building of several building proposals for a new New York Jets [[West Side Stadium|football stadium]], the owners of the New York Jets were willing to split the $1.5 billion cost of building a new football stadium over Manhattan's West Side rail yards however the proposal never came to fruition.

New York also has two [[Major League Baseball]] teams, the [[New York Yankees]] (based in [[The Bronx]]), and the [[New York Mets]] (based in New York City borough [[Queens]]). New York is home to three [[National Hockey League]] franchises (the [[New York Rangers]] in [[Manhattan]], the [[New York Islanders]] on [[Long Island]] and the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]). New York has a [[National Basketball Association]] team, the [[New York Knicks]] in [[Manhattan]].The former New York Nets from 1968 to 1977 is now titled as a New Jersey team however plans to relocate to New York City are in the works. There are a variety of minor league teams that can be found all through the State of New York such as the [[Long Island Ducks]].

}}
The '''Subaru Impreza''' is a [[compact car]] that was first introduced by [[Subaru]] in 1993.

&quot;Impreza&quot; is a coined word, deriving from an originally [[Italian language|Italian]] word, impresa, meaning a feat or achievement. In [[Polish language|Polish]], &quot;Impreza&quot; means &quot;party&quot;, &quot;event&quot; or &quot;show&quot;.

The Impreza was introduced after the popular [[Subaru Leone|Leone]]/[[Subaru Loyale|Loyale]] was cancelled with the aging [[Subaru EA engine|EA series]] engine. The Impreza was introduced with the popular [[Subaru EJ engine|EJ series]] engine found in the larger [[Subaru Legacy]]. In Japan, the Impreza sells more than the larger Legacy due to Japanese [[Vehicle size class#Japan|vehicle size legislation]], which offers a reduced tax liability because of its smaller exterior dimensions.

Compared to vehicles in a similar size class such as [[Toyota Corolla]], [[Honda Civic]], [[Nissan Sentra]], [[Suzuki SX4]], [[Mitsubishi Lancer]] (including [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]]) and [[Mazda 323|Mazda Protegé]]/[[Mazda Axela]], only the Impreza has always offered [[Four-wheel drive|AWD]]. Subaru Impreza made this feature standard equipment in all trims, while its competitor, [[Mitsubishi Lancer]] puts this feature to [[Ralliart]] trims and [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution|Evolution]] versions. Subaru produces a lower volume of slightly upscale, well-equipped, sportier Impreza models, unlike other contemporaries in the compact category that offer [[economy car|no-frills base trims]].
&lt;ref name=&quot;motortrend1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0707_2007_honda_civic_vs_2007_hyundai_elantra_vs_2007_mitsubishi_lancer_vs_2007_nissan_sentra_comparison/mitsubishi_lancer.html |title=2007 Honda Civic vs 2007 Hyundai Elantra vs 2007 Mitsubishi Lancer vs 2007 Nissan Sentra - Comfort |publisher=Motor Trend |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subaru chose to continue their longstanding use of the [[boxer engine]] in the Impreza. According to Subaru, their configuration of the engine inline with the transmission minimizes body roll due to the lower center of gravity compared with offset engines in most other vehicles. This is similar to the design of the [[Citroen 2CV]], providing light weight and compact, economic design for basic cars. The boxer design provides good vibration mitigation due to the principles of a [[Engine balance|balanced engine]] because the movement of each piston is largely countered by a piston in the opposing cylinder bank, eliminating the need for a counter-rotating weighted crankshaft ([[harmonic balancer]]), but with some vibration from offsets. [[Torque steer]] is also reduced with this type of powertrain layout since the front drive shafts are of equal length and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Introduced in November 1993, the Impreza was offered in either [[front wheel drive]] (FWD) or [[all wheel drive]] (AWD) versions and as a four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]/saloon or five-door [[station wagon]]/estate. According to a ''[[Motor Trend]]'' article written March 1992 on page 26, the name of Subaru's new compact was, initially, to be called the [[Subaru Leone|Loyale]], displaying an official photograph of the 4-door sedan. In late 1995, a two-door [[coupe]] was introduced. The Impreza, like many Subaru-built [[car]]s, was equipped with a [[flat engine]], a distinguishing Subaru characteristic.  Initial engine choices included 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0-litre naturally-aspirated engines as well as the [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] and [[Intercooler|intercooled]] 2.0-litre engine.  The basic turbocharged motor, the '''EJ20''', produced from {{convert|244|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|210|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} in Japanese market [[Subaru Impreza WRX|WRX]] trim depending on model and year.  Outside Japan, the turbocharged model was initially rated at {{convert|211|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} and marketed as the 2.0 Turbo, 2.0 GT, 2.0 GT Turbo, 2.0 WRX, or Turbo 2000 AWD in the United Kingdom.

Trim levels were LX, GL and Sport. LX models were front-wheel drive, and powered by a 1.6-litre engine; these were four-door only.
GL trim levels were either front-wheel drive (Subaru badged these 2WD) or all-wheel-drive (badged AWD); cars launched in 1993 had a choice of 1.6 and 1.8 [[flat-4]] engines, the 1.6 being available with 2WD, the 1.8 an AWD version only. From 1996, the 1.6 and 1.8 versions were dropped (in the European market), and replaced by a 2.0-[[litre]] engine. Sport versions had alloy wheels, and a 2.0-litre engine only. These were &quot;warm hatch&quot; versions which were similar to the WRX, albeit less adorned.

In 1994, Subaru introduced [[Subaru Technica International]] (STi) versions of the Impreza in the [[Japanese Domestic Market]] (JDM) and European Domestic Market (EDM). These models were upgraded from the WRX in many categories, including blueprinted performance-tuned engines, transmissions, and suspensions.  The [[Subaru Impreza WRX STi|STi]] versions of the Impreza were immensely successful in rallies and popular among street racers.  The first STi models featured higher power ratings than the WRX, while later versions of both WRX and STi were rated at {{convert|280|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} due to the Japanese manufacturers' informal agreements around power ratings.  Its top [[speed]] was electronically limited at {{convert|180|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and it had a 0–100&amp;nbsp;[[Kilometers per hour|km/h]] time of 4.9&amp;nbsp;[[second]]s in the UK Impreza Turbo {{convert|218|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}} version. 2006 WRX STI claimed 0 to 100&amp;nbsp;km/h in 5.4 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/509/subaru-impreza-wrx-sti-2006-my06/ |title=Subaru Impreza WRX STi 2006 MY06 |work=Australian Car Advice |date=2007-07-15 |accessdate=2008-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RA (Race Altered) versions of the WRX and STi were also available in the Japanese market.  Targeted for race and rally, the RA versions were generally lighter in weight; featuring reduced soundproofing, manual windows, no air conditioning, and added racing features such as more robust engines, driver controlled center differentials, and shorter gearing.

Special editions of the Impreza were very common in Japan and Europe, many coinciding with a significant World Rally Championship victory.  These editions included the [[Series McRae]], [[555]], [[Catalunya]], [[Terzo]], [[Subaru impreza RB5|RB5]], [[P1]], and [[22B]], the latter still considered by many to be the ultimate Impreza of all time with its wide arched rally style body.

During this generation, Subaru made a limited edition Impreza Sport Wagon called the CasaBlanca,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardatabase.net/?pid=00079059 |title=CarDatabase.net - Subaru Impreza Casablanca Wagon |accessdate=2008-02-06 |work=CarDatabase.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; which had a [[retro]] front and rear end treatment, which was inspired by the popular [[kei car]] [[Subaru Vivio|Subaru Vivio Bistro]] styling package and [[Subaru Sambar#1990-1998|Subaru Sambar Dias Classic]]. The Sport Wagon was also offered with the WRX turbocharged engine, and was called the [[Subaru Outback#Subaru Outback Sport|Gravel Express]]. 

The Impreza received an external facelift for the 1997 model year, followed by an interior redesign in 1998, using the new redesigned dashboard from the Forester.

The European 1999-2000 turbo model received further upgrades in the form of more parts from the STi range. The front brakes became Subaru branded 4-pot calipers with 294&amp;nbsp;mm discs, the wheels having become {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} lightweight alloys from 1998 - previously {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}}, vented rear discs, the Sti 4 high level wing was fitted to the saloon, Sti style front bucket seats and firmer suspension. The phase 2 engine now fitted developed {{convert|160|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, an increase of {{convert|5|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} over the previous model.

The story of the North American Impreza is much different than the rest of the world.  North American markets never received a turbocharged version of the first generation Impreza (it was heavily rumored in 1998 and 1999).  Subaru never had a performance image in North America, so Subaru initially offered the Impreza with the 1.8L engine only, with either front- or all-wheel drive; a 2.2-liter engine became optional in 1995.  Subaru later decided to emphasize all-wheel drive, making it standard on every Impreza (and Legacy) from 1997 onwards.

There was a minority that knew of the Impreza's accomplishments overseas and was very interested in having a high-performance Impreza.  To test the waters for a full-fledged turbo model Subaru showcased a turbocharged version of the Impreza at various car shows around the country. The vehicle was named the 2.5RX and is now located in Subaru of America's Cherry Hill, NJ storage facility. Subsequently the 2.5RS performance model was introduced in 1998 (the same year the 1.8-liter engine was dropped).  A naturally-aspirated {{convert|165|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2.5L [[DOHC]] engine and larger brakes, borrowed from the [[Subaru Legacy|Legacy]], were fitted into the coupe body with gold-colored 16&quot; five-spoke wheels.  The 2.5RS also featured several external cues from its overseas brethren such as hood vents, a hood scoop, and a rally-inspired rear spoiler.  The 1999 model featured several changes: the newly designed &quot;Phase II&quot; [[SOHC]] version of the same 2.5L engine featured a slightly higher peak torque ({{convert|225|N.m|kgf.m ftlbf|abbr=on}} vs. {{convert|220|N.m|kgf.m ftlbf|abbr=on}}), the wheels turned to a standard silver, the interior got an update, and US versions became visually similar to their Japanese contemporaries with an updated front bumper borrowed from the Japanese Version 6 Impreza WRX STi.  2.5RS models became available in [[sedan (car)|sedan]] form in 2000.

Subaru introduced the &quot;New Age&quot; Impreza to the world market in 2000.  The second generation Impreza was intended to be larger, safer, stiffer, more refined, and more responsive.  For many enthusiasts, the changes in the new car made it less desirable because it was heavier and slower with less of a raw edge to it.  The WRX Sedan had a 20&amp;nbsp;mm wider track than its predecessor to aid handling, while the wagon remained the same.  The coupe model was no longer available.  The disliked headlamp styling of the New Age Impreza was polarizing, but the improvements to the car brought greater mainstream acceptance.

For quick and easy reference to the different exteriors, some Subaru Impreza owners use nicknames based on the headlights. Each relates to a creature that has similar looking eyes: 2000-2002 are 'bug eyes' / 2002-2005 are 'crocodile' or 'blob eyes' / 2004-2007 are 'hawk eyes'.

In the United States, release of the basic {{convert|227|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2.0&amp;nbsp;L turbocharged Impreza, the WRX, did not occur until the 2002 model year, and the Impreza WRX STi was delayed until the 2004 model year.  The US version of the STi includes various departures from the Japanese and European counterparts, such as a turbocharged 2.5&amp;nbsp;L '''EJ257''' engine, rather than the [[twin turbo#Sequential twin-turbo|twin scroll turbo]] 2.0&amp;nbsp;L engine sold elsewhere. All 2006 American Imprezas use some form of the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L EJ25 engine since naturally aspirated and turbo charged are available. Start from 2003, the US-spec Impreza was built in [[Lafayette, Indiana]] [[USA]] for celebrate ten years of Impreza and solving the import problems.

[[Image:04-05 Subaru Impreza 2.5RS.jpg|thumb|left|2004 Subaru Impreza 2.5 RS]]
Some customers' and the press' negative reaction to the New Age Impreza's styling forced Subaru to facelift the car in 2003 for 2004 model year, with more conventional, rectangular headlamps, nicknamed 'crocodile eyes' (although many still use the 'blob eyes' nickname). For the US market, the facelifted Impreza was offered as 2.5 RS Sedan and Wagon, 2.5 Outback Sport Wagon, WRX Sedan and Wagon, and the new WRX STi Sedan. Sport Package was optional for the RS, and the WRX could be ordered with Premium Package. The RS, Outback Sport, and WRX are available with manual or automatic transmission, while the sole transmission for the STi is 6 speed manual.

All 2006 Imprezas, including the performance models, have been redesigned again with the controversial &quot;jet intake and wings&quot; grille first debuted on the [[Subaru B9 Tribeca]] [[crossover SUV]], along with new headlights (nicknamed 'hawk eyes'), taillights, and bumpers. Opinion on this style is split, but is generally regarded as better applied on the Impreza than the Tribeca. The grille design was dropped in the 3rd generation Impreza, due to the restyling. The 2.5 RS was dropped from the line up, and replaced by the base model 2.5i.

The most basic Impreza in Japan is '''1.5 i''' with 1.5 liter EJ15 [[SOHC]] engine. The '''1.5 R''' comes with the 1.5&amp;nbsp;L [[DOHC]] engine with [[AVCS]], but is only available with automatic transmission, whereas the 1.5i model is available with either [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] or [[manual transmission]]. For both models, AWD and 2WD versions are available. Option packages for either the 1.5i or 1.5R include wheel type, size, bucket seats, and white LED illuminated gauge meters. Starting with model year 2006, the EJ15 was replaced with the new [[List of Subaru engines#Subaru EL engine|EL15]]

In 2005, Subaru made their [[AVCS]] standard on all engines used in the Impreza.

For export market, the all-wheel drive '''1.6 TS''' is offered in [[Singapore]] and other Asian countries. The 1.5 sedan is normal body similar to the Sports Wagon. The TS shares wide body with WRX and WRX STI.

=== 2004 ===
Models offered in [[Australia]] in 2004 included the GX (2.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Internal combustion engine|engine]], this model has become the baseline Impreza in Australia), RV (2.0&amp;nbsp;L engine, styled for active lifestyles, similar to the USA-spec Impreza Outback Sport), RS (2.5&amp;nbsp;L engine, sport model) along with the WRX and STi version thereof. The RX model has been abandoned in Australia, and its position in the Impreza line-up has been subsumed by the GX (which had formerly been a sparsely outfitted budget model).  A variant of the RS for Australia is the RS-X, which whilst technically not a naturally-aspirated version of the WRX as is often claimed, does feature many WRX components, including wheels and brakes, in a package powered by the 2.5 litre drivetrain.

=== 2005-2007 ===
In late 2004 a new range was released; including the entry-level 2.0i (formerly GX), RV, 2.0R (formerly RS), WRX and WRX STi models. The 2.0R changed from a 2.5 L engine to a slightly more powerful 2.0 L engine; while the turbocharged WRX changed from a 2.0 L engine to a 2.5 L engine. The [[automatic transmission]] was dropped from the WRX, despite the popularity of the sports shift automatic in other Subarus such as the [[Subaru Outback|Outback]]. In 2006 the automatic transmission was added to the Limited package, which includes heated leather seats, power mirrors, heated wiper blades and a [[sunroof]]. Side airbags were added as standard across the range. Subaru Impreza WRXs have been bought by [[National Gendarmerie|French Gendarmerie]] for its Motorway patrols.
At the New York Auto Show, Subaru introduced a new WRX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/04/05/new-york-auto-show-2008-subaru-impreza-wrx-takes-the-stage/ |title=New York Auto Show: 2008 Subaru Impreza WRX takes the stage |work=[[Autoblog]] |accessdate=2008-02-06 |date=2007-04-05 |author=Eric Bryant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2008-2009 Subaru Impreza R sedan 02.jpg|left|thumb|2008–2009 Subaru Impreza R sedan (Australia)]]

On 2 April 2007, Subaru officially unveiled the next generation [[Subaru Impreza WRX|Impreza WRX]] at the 2007 [[New York Auto Show]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AB2008release&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/04/03/officially-official-subaru-releases-full-details-on-2008-imprez/ |title=Officially Official: Subaru releases full details on 2008 Impreza |accessdate=2007-04-24 |last=Nunez |first=Alex |date=2007-04-03 |publisher=[[Autoblog]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to its usual rival, the [[Mitsubishi Lancer]], the Impreza WRX is increasingly being positioned as a 'practical' performance car - the suspension for instance is more accommodating of everyday roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/subaru/impreza/review.html |title=Subaru Impreza Review |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/subaru/impreza/2008/review.html |title=2008 Subaru Impreza Review |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar to the marketing of the Lancer, Subaru plans to offer a lower volume of slightly upscale, well-equipped, sportier Impreza models, unlike other contemporaries such as the [[Honda Civic]], [[Mazda3]], and [[Toyota Corolla]] that offer [[economy car|no-frills base trims]].
&lt;ref name=&quot;motortrend1&quot;/&gt;  The new Impreza is offered as both a 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback.

The new base model Impreza is slightly longer, wider and has a longer wheel base. The dashboard in the Impreza is much more open and is easy to configure. Two Subaru traditions have been ended with the new Impreza: the parking light switch atop the steering column is no longer present, and for the first time the windows have frames to improve [[Noise, Vibration, and Harshness|NVH]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Subaru Impreza | year = 2007 | magazine = [[Wheels magazine]]: July 2007 | page = 198 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2008 Subaru Impreza 2.5i hatch rear.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Subaru Impreza 2.5i hatchback (US)]]

In the Japanese domestic market the range comprises the 1.5 litre 15S using the [[List of Subaru engines#Subaru EL engine|EL15]] series engine, the 2.0 litre 20S and the 2.0 litre turbocharged S-GT using the EJ20 series engine. Variations are found in other markets around the world: In Australia the range at launch included three 2.0 litre models (the R, RX and RS) and a 2.5 litre turbocharged WRX.

In the United States market (the US and Canadian markets were the only ones to receive the sedan until it made its Japanese debut in fall 2008 as ''''Impreza Anesis'''') for the 2008 model year, the model range consists of the 2.5 liter, 2.5i and Outback Sport and the 2.5 liter turbocharged WRX. Both the 2.5 and the 2.5i are electronically limited from surpassing {{convert|190|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. The EJ253 engine carries over from the previous generation to power the 2.5i and the EJ255 engine carries over from the previous generation (although it now uses many external engine components from the [[Subaru Legacy|Legacy GT]]) to power the turbocharged [[Subaru Impreza WRX|WRX]] trim levels.  In the Canadian market, the base Impreza 2.5i model received upgrades for the 2009 model year, including rear disc brakes, electronic stability control and traction control, and body-colored door handles, features previously only found on the 2.5 Sport and more expensive trims. The North America Impreza has no mention of an approved towing capacity while identical models in other markets have an official tow rating.  The US-built Impreza will continue assembly, but the WRX STi has paused - due to the economical problems.

From September 2007 the Impreza range in Australia has been changed with models designated  R, RX, RS and WRX. Initially only hatch models were offered. The R, RX and RS all share the same engine - a new 2.0 L, with {{convert|110|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} @ 6400 rpm and 196 Nm @ 3200 rpm. Subaru recommends that the new engines be run on 95 RON premium unleaded fuel. Another noticeable difference from the Japanese Impreza is the removal of the &quot;Engine Start&quot; button from the Australian model. The iconic WRX has largely unchanged engine power output of {{convert|169|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} and 320 Nm from its 2.5 L engine. As with previous versions, there will only be a manual version of the WRX. The weight of the car also has been lightened (by ~50 lbs) to just 1400&amp;nbsp;kg, and gives the WRX a 0–100&amp;nbsp;km/h time of 5.8 seconds. In contrast, curb weight of the standard Impreza model is ~60 lbs heavier, although still lighter than the WRX trim level.

In Israel, the Impreza is denoted as the B3, and three styles are offered: the B3 1.5, with a 1.5 liter engine, the B3 2.0 and the B3 2.0 Sport, both with 2.0 liter engines. Four-door and five-door models are available for each engine type, ranging from the basic R class, to the medium RX and top RXI class. No 2.5 liter engine option is available.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.subaru.co.il/models_b3.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Impreza20RWhiteFL1PP.jpg|thumb|right|Subaru Impreza 2.0 R Hatchback]]
The third generation Impreza is sold in certain Asian countries in 1.5 R, 2.0 R, 2.0 S-GT, 2.5 WRX, and 2.5 WRX STI trim levels. In [[Indonesia]], the Impreza is only available as 5 door Hatchback only, but all trim levels are offered.
The 1.5 R and 2.0 R can be ordered with Dual Range 5 speed manual, or 4 speed automatic SPORTSHIFT electronically-controlled transmission. However, in [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]], the Impreza 1.5 R, 2.0 R, and 2.5 WRX are also offered as 4 door Sedan.

The latest-generation of the WRX STI which is built as &quot;wide body&quot; hatchback only debuted in the Tokyo Auto Show in October 2007. The release date for a US launch was in March 2008.  The WRX STI chassis code is GR, different from the GH used for the &quot;standard body&quot; hatchback WRX chassis. The Japanese WRX STI is powered by 2.0 liter improved EJ207 engine with twin scroll turbo, while the American and other export models has 2.5 liter EJ257 with single scroll turbo. The Impreza WRX STI features a Multi-Mode Driver Controlled Centre Differential (DCCD).

====Facelift Model====
[[File:2010 Subaru Impreza sedan -- 03-13-2010.jpg|thumb|200px|right|2010 Subaru Impreza sedan (US)]]
A facelifted 2010 model of the Subaru Impreza went on sale in late 2009, receiving a new grille.

In the 2010 New York International Auto Show, Subaru unveiled the 2011 model year &quot;wide body&quot; Impreza WRX Sedan and Hatchback, as well as the Impreza WRX STI 4 door Sedan. The new STI Sedan features high rear spoiler similar to the old STI.

==== Safety ====
Safety of the car has been increased with range wide inclusion of Stability/Traction control as standard in some markets.
In early September 2007, the [[IIHS]] crash-tested the 2.5i 5-door Impreza and gave it the highest ranking available due 
to the test results the car achieved, continuing Subaru's reputation for producing cars that consistently earn the institutes highest rating.&lt;ref name=&quot;iihs&quot;/&gt;

The Impreza also achieved a 5 Star Safety Rating, and a 4 Star Pedestrian Safety rating in the [[Australasian New Car Assessment Program|ANCAP]] crash tests.

==== Diesel ====
A boxer diesel engine, called the [[List of Subaru engines#Subaru EE engine (diesel)|Subaru EE]], for European Impreza models was introduced at the 2008 [[Paris Motor Show]]. The diesel Impreza was made available for sale in several European countries in early 2009, with the 2.0 litre turbodiesel engine of 150 horsepower. Two models are available as of July 2009, 2.0 TD and 2.0 TD Sport, which is better equipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.subaru.fi/datasheet/subaruPricelist.pdf |title=Subaru pricelist 2009 Finland |accessdate=2009-07-14 |format=PDF |language=fi |work=Subaru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reputation ==
Subaru uses the Impreza chassis for the mechanical underpinnings of the [[Subaru Forester|Forester]], a small [[crossover SUV]] designed to compete in the segment comprising the [[Honda CR-V]] and [[Ford Escape]].

As a result of GM's investment in Fuji Heavy Industries and ownership of Saab, the [[badge engineered]] [[Saab 9-2X]] used the second generation Impreza wagon, released in 2005 (given the rally-derived &quot;Saab Rally Wagon&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/class/marketplace/cars/0612wheels12saabintro.html |title=Saab, Subaru team up for niche 'Saabaru' |date=2004-06-12 |accessdate=2008-02-20 |author=Bob Golfen |publisher=azcentral.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was discontinued in 2006 due to the dissolution of the Subaru-GM partnership.

Subaru sold a cosmetically altered (in the [[neoclassic (automobile)|neoclassic]] style) sedan and wagon in Asia called the Subaru Casa Blanca.

The Impreza chassis has been more successful in [[rallying]] than Subaru's previous contenders. Prior to the introduction of the Impreza into [[World Rally Championship]] racing in 1993, the [[Subaru World Rally Team]] had fielded its larger [[mid-size]] [[Subaru Legacy|Legacy]].  However, with the rest of the rally competition increasingly shifting towards smaller and lighter chassis, Subaru introduced the smaller Impreza, immediately achieving a podium on its debut on the 1993 [[1000 Lakes Rally]]. To jumpstart its early rally efforts, and to develop the Impreza into a competitive rally car, Subaru teamed up with its current preporatory firm, British motorsports company [[Prodrive]], in 1989.

Immediately following the first overall WRC event win for both the fledgling Subaru team and its young driver, the late [[Colin McRae]] aboard a [[Group A]] [[Subaru Legacy|Legacy]] on the [[1993 World Rally Championship season|1993]] [[Rally New Zealand]], the [[Scotland|Scotman]]'s team-mate and childhood idol, [[1981 World Rally Championship season|1981]] [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|World Rally Champion]], [[Ari Vatanen]] of [[Finland]], went on to finish second in the debut rally of the first ever factory Impreza. New recruit for the following season, [[1990 World Rally Championship season|1990]] and [[1992 World Rally Championship season|1992]] World Champion, [[Carlos Sainz]] brought the Impreza its inaugural victory on the [[1994 World Rally Championship season|1994]] [[Acropolis Rally]].

The Impreza brought [[Subaru]] three consecutive WRC [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' Champions|constructors' titles]] ([[1995 World Rally Championship season|1995]]–[[1997 World Rally Championship season|1997]], the latter season the first for the newly introduced [[World Rally Car]] class) and a driver's championship for McRae in 1995, the late [[Richard Burns]] in [[2001 World Rally Championship season|2001]], and the [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Petter Solberg]] in [[2003 World Rally Championship season|2003]].

Another evolution of the Impreza WRC made its debut in the 2007 [[Corona Rally Mexico]]. Unfortunately, the team had several major problems with reliability as the car experienced mechanical difficulties in almost every rally from its first.

Subaru debuted an Impreza WRC in hatchback form for the first time from the [[2008 World Rally Championship season|2008]] [[Acropolis Rally]] onwards, on which event Solberg scored a second place finish.

On 16 December 2008 Subaru announced that it would withdraw from the [[World Rally Championship]] due to economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title= Subaru to withdraw from World Rally Championship
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Subaru Rally Team USA is still competing in the Rally America National Championship. Also, there are still several teams using Subaru models in the Intercontinental Rally Challenge.

== Safety ==
In Australia, the 1993-2004 Subaru Impreza was assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings 2006 as providing &quot;average&quot; protection for its occupants in the event of a crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/downloads/buyers_guide_used_car_safety_ratings.pdf |title=Buyers Guide to used Car Safety Ratings 2006 |accessdate=2008-02-06 |format=PDF |language=en |work=RTA.nsw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.howsafeisyourcar.com.au/_scripts/ucsr_search_result.php?IID=16999 |title=SAFETY REPORT: SUBARU IMPREZA (1993-2000) |accessdate=2008-02-06 |work=HowSafeIsYourCar.com.au |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.howsafeisyourcar.com.au/_scripts/ucsr_search_result.php?IID=16910 |title=SAFETY REPORT: SUBARU IMPREZA (2001-2005) |accessdate=2008-02-06 |work=HowSafeIsYourCar.com.au |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In frontal-offset and side crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in the United States, the second-generation Impreza earned &quot;Good&quot; ratings.  2005-2007 models also earned a &quot;Good&quot; rating for rear crash protection (head restraint design) placing it at the top of IIHS small car ratings.

The third generation MY2008 Impreza continued the tradition and also earned the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety highest rating for &quot;Good&quot; in each individual test, earning an overall score of &quot;Good&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;iihs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=349 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Subaru Impreza |accessdate=2008-02-06 |work=IIHS.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third generation MY2008 Impreza hatchback received five stars (34.66 out of 37 points) for occupant protection and a four star pedestrian rating under testing by ANCAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Awards and acknowledgments ==
The Impreza was ''[[Wheels magazine|Wheels]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year]] for 2000.  [[Car and Driver]] Magazine named the North American market WRX to its prestigious [[Car and Driver Ten Best|10-best]] list in 2002, with a follow-up performance in 2003.

==History==
{{Main|History of Tokyo}}
[[Image:Tokugawa 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]]]
Tokyo was originally a small fishing village named Edo.

It was first fortified by the [[Edo clan]], in the late 12th century.

In 1457, [[Ōta Dōkan]] built [[Edo Castle]]. In 1590, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] made Edo his base and when he became [[shogun]] in 1603, the town became the center of his nationwide military government. During the subsequent [[Edo period]], Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After about 263 years, the shogunate was overthrown under the banner of [[Meiji Restoration|restoring imperial rule]]. In 1869, the 17-year-old [[Emperor Meiji]] moved to Edo. Tokyo was already the nation's political and cultural center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the emperor's residence made it a ''de facto'' imperial capital as well with the former [[Edo Castle]] becoming the [[Kokyo|Imperial Palace]]. The [[Tokyo City|city of Tokyo]] was established, and continued to be the capital until it was abolished as a municipality in 1943 and merged with the &quot;Metropolitan Prefecture&quot; of Tokyo.

Central Tokyo, like [[Osaka]], has been designed since about 1900 to be centered around major train stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]]. This differs from many cities in the [[United States]] that are low-density and automobile-centric. Though [[Shuto Expressway|expressways]] have been built in Tokyo, the basic design has not changed.

Tokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century, but it recovered from both. One was the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]], which left 140,000 dead or missing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1421140/Tokyo-Yokohama-earthquake-of-1923 Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake of 1923]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the other was [[World War II]]. The [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945]], with 75,000 to 200,000 killed and half of the city destroyed, was almost as devastating as the atomic bombs of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Japan: A Social and Political History |author=Tipton, Elise K. |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:sto1012.jpg|left|thumb|Ginza during the allied occupation period]]
After the war, Tokyo was completely rebuilt, and was showcased to the world during the [[1964 Summer Olympics]]. The 1970s brought new high-rise developments such as [[Sunshine 60]], a new and controversial&lt;ref&gt;[http://tokyo-nrt.airports-guides.com/ &quot;Tokyo Narita International Airport (NRT) Airport Information (Tokyo, Japan)&quot;].

The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's &quot;[[lost decade (Japan)|lost decade]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Tokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include [[Ebisu, Tokyo|Ebisu]] Garden Place, Tennozu Isle, [[Shiodome]], [[Roppongi Hills]], [[Shinagawa, Tokyo|Shinagawa]] (now also a [[Shinkansen]] station), and the [[Marunouchi]] side of [[Tokyo Station]]. Buildings of significance are demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as [[Omotesando Hills]].

Land reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the [[Odaiba]] area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of [[Tokyo Bay]] and measures about 90&amp;nbsp;km east to west and 25&amp;nbsp;km north to south. [[Chiba Prefecture]] borders it to the east, [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]] to the west, [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]] to the south, and [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]] to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area ({{lang|ja|多摩地域}}) stretching westwards.

[[Image:TokyoMetropolitanGovernmentOffice.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building]]]] Also within the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the [[Pacific Ocean]] directly south: the [[Izu Islands]], and the [[Ogasawara Islands]], which stretch more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;km away from the mainland. Because of these islands and mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far underrepresent the real figures for urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.

Under [[Japanese law]], Tokyo is designated as a ''to'' ({{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:都|都]]}}), translated as ''[[metropolis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |pages=8
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]]. Within Tokyo lie dozens of smaller entities, including many cities, the twenty-three special wards, districts, towns, villages, a quasi-national park, and a national park. The [[Special wards of Tokyo|twenty-three special wards]] ({{lang|ja|特別[[wiktionary:区|区]]}} -ku), which until 1943 comprised the [[Tokyo City|city of Tokyo]], are now separate, self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.

In addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities ([[wiktionary:市|市]] -shi), five towns ({{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:町|町]]}} -chō or machi), and eight villages ({{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:村|村]]}} -son or -mura), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building|headquarters]] are in the ward of [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]]. They govern all of Tokyo, including lakes, rivers, dams, farms, remote islands, and [[national parks]] in addition to its neon jungles, skyscrapers and crowded subways.

===Special wards===
[[Image:Tokyo Special Wards.png|thumb|right|A map of Tokyo's 23 Special wards]]
The [[Special wards of Tokyo|special wards]] (''tokubetsu-ku'') of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. On July 1, 1943, Tokyo City was merged with {{nihongo|Tokyo Prefecture|東京府|Tōkyō-fu}} forming the current &quot;metropolitan prefecture&quot;. As a result, unlike other [[wards of Japan|city wards]] in Japan, these wards are not part of any larger incorporated city.
Each ward is a [[Municipalities of Japan|municipality]] with its own elected mayor and assembly like the other cities of Japan. The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government.  Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.  To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/PROFILE/overview06.htm The Structure of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government] (Tokyo government webpage)&lt;/ref&gt;

The special wards of Tokyo are:
{|

===Western Tokyo===
[[File:Cities in Western Tokyo Metropolis.png|thumb|right|A map of cities in western part of Tokyo]]
To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan.

While serving as &quot;[[Bedroom community|bed towns]]&quot; for those working in central Tokyo, some of these also have a local commercial and industrial base. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama Area or [[Western Tokyo]].

====Cities====
Twenty-six cities lie within the western part of Tokyo:
{|
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
|
* [[Akiruno, Tokyo|Akiruno]]
* [[Akishima, Tokyo|Akishima]]
* [[Chōfu, Tokyo|Chōfu]]
* [[Fuchū, Tokyo|Fuchū]]
* [[Fussa, Tokyo|Fussa]]
* [[Hachiōji, Tokyo|Hachiōji]]
* [[Hamura, Tokyo|Hamura]]
* [[Higashikurume, Tokyo|Higashikurume]]

* [[Inagi, Tokyo|Inagi]]
* [[Kiyose, Tokyo|Kiyose]]
* [[Kodaira, Tokyo|Kodaira]]
* [[Koganei, Tokyo|Koganei]]
* [[Kokubunji, Tokyo|Kokubunji]]

* [[Nishitōkyō, Tokyo|Nishitōkyō]]
* [[Ōme, Tokyo|Ōme]]
* [[Tachikawa, Tokyo|Tachikawa]]
* [[Tama, Tokyo|Tama]]
|}

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachiōji, Tachikawa, Machida, Ōme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=Bureau of Urban Development, Tokyo Metropolitan Government
}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their plans to disperse urban functions away from central Tokyo.

====Districts, towns and villages====
The far west is occupied by the district (''gun'') of [[Nishitama, Tokyo|Nishitama]]. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, [[Mount Kumotori]], is 2,017&amp;nbsp;m high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takasu (1737&amp;nbsp;m), Odake (1266&amp;nbsp;m), and [[Mount Mitake|Mitake]] (929&amp;nbsp;m). [[Lake Okutama]], on the [[Tama River]] near [[Yamanashi Prefecture]], is Tokyo's largest lake.

===Islands===
[[Image:Hachijo-jima.JPG|thumb|[[Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park]]]]
Tokyo has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1850&amp;nbsp;km from central Tokyo. Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the metropolitan government in Shinjuku, local offices administer them.

The [[Izu Islands]] are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the [[Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park]]. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are [[Izu Ōshima]], [[Toshima Island|Toshima]], [[Niijima]], [[Shikinejima]], [[Kozushima]], [[Miyakejima]], [[Mikurajima]], [[Hachijojima]], and [[Aogashima]]. Izu Ōshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming [[Niijima, Tokyo|one village]].

The [[Ogasawara, Tokyo|Ogasawara]] Islands include, from north to south, [[Chichi-jima]], [[Nishinoshima]], [[Haha-jima]], [[Kita Iwo Jima]], [[Iwo Jima]], and [[Minami Iwo Jima]]. Ogasawara also administers two tiny outlying islands: [[Minami Torishima]], the easternmost point in Japan and at 1,850&amp;nbsp;km the most distant island from central Tokyo, and [[Okino Torishima]], the southernmost point in Japan. The last island is contested by the [[People's Republic of China]] as being only uninhabited rocks. The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but host [[Japanese Self-Defense Forces]] personnel. Local populations are only found on [[Chichi-jima]] and [[Haha-jima]]. The islands form the village of Ogasawara.

===National parks===
There are several national parks within Tokyo, among them:
* [[Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park]], around [[Mount Takao]] to the south of Hachiōji
* [[Ogasawara Islands|Ogasawara National Park]]. [[Wikipedia:As of|As of]] 2006, efforts were being made to make Ogasawara National Park a [[UNESCO]] natural [[World Heritage Site]].
* [[Ueno Park]], well known for its museums: [[Tokyo National Museum]], [[National Science Museum of Japan|National Science Museum]], [[Shitamachi Museum]] and [[The National Museum of Western Art|National Museum for Western Art]], among others. There are also art works and statues at several places in the park.

===Climate===
Tokyo lies in the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone ([[Koppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''),&lt;ref&gt;Peel, M. C., Finlayson, B. L., and McMahon, T.

Sci., 11, 1633-1644, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; with hot humid summers and generally mild winters with cool spells. The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag, with the warmest month being August, which averages {{convert|27.5|C|1}}, and the coolest month being January, averaging {{convert|6.0|C|1}}. Annual rainfall averages nearly {{convert|1470|mm|in|1}}, with a wetter summer and a drier winter. Snowfall is sporadic, but does occur almost annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

As of October 2007, the official [[intercensal estimate]] showed 12.79 million people in Tokyo with 8.653 million living within Tokyo's 23 wards.&lt;ref name=population/&gt; During the daytime, the population swells by over 2.5 million as workers and students commute from adjacent areas. This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]], [[Chūō, Tokyo|Chūō]], and [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]], whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4 million during the day.&lt;ref name=population/&gt;

The entire prefecture had 12,790,000 residents in October 2007 (8,653,000 in 23 wards), with an increase of over 3 million in the day. Tokyo is at its highest population ever, while that of the 23 wards peak official count was 8,893,094 in the 1965 Census, with the count dipping below 8 million in the 1995 Census.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} People continue to move back into the core city as land prices have fallen dramatically.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

As of 2005, the most common foreign nationalities found in Tokyo are Chinese (123,661), Korean (106,697), Filipino (31,077), American (18,848), British (7,696), Brazilian (5,300) and French (3,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Tokyo is one of the three world finance &quot;[[command center]]s&quot;, along with [[New York City]] and [[London]]. Tokyo has the [[List of cities by GDP|largest metropolitan economy in the world]]. According to a study conducted by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], the Tokyo [[urban area]] (35.2 million people) had a total GDP of US$1.479 trillion in 2008 (at [[purchasing power parity]]), which topped the list.&lt;ref name=&quot;pricewater&quot;/&gt; As of 2008, 47 of the companies listed on the [[Fortune Global 500|Global 500]] are based in Tokyo, almost twice that of the second-placed city ([[Paris]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2008/cities/|title=Global 500 Our annual ranking of the world's largest corporationns|accessdate=2008-12-04|publisher=CNNMoney.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following [[World War II]], many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as [[Osaka]] (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.

Tokyo was rated by the [[The Economist|Economist Intelligence Unit]] as the most expensive (highest [[Cost-of-living index|cost-of-living]]) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-01-31T113907Z_01_L312905_RTRUKOC_0_US-LIFE-CITIES.xml&amp;archived=False |title=Oslo is world's most expensive city: survey |publisher=Reuters |date=January 31, 2006 |accessdate=February 1}} (inactive).&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis is for living a corporate executive lifestyle, with items like a detached house and several automobiles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] is Japan's largest [[stock exchange]], and second largest in the world by [[market capitalization]] and fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990 at the end of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]], it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stock-market.in/2007/02/26/tokyo-stock-exchange/ Tokyo stock exchange]&lt;/ref&gt;
Tokyo had 8,460&amp;nbsp;ha (20,900&amp;nbsp;acres) of agricultural land as of 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maff.go.jp/esokuhou/sei200305.pdf |title=Statistics on Cultivated Land Area |authors=Horticulture Statistics Team, Production Statistics Division, Statistics and Information Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries |date=July 15, 2003 |accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]], placing it last among the nation's prefectures. The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo. Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture. [[Komatsuna|Japanese leaf spinach]] and [[spinach]] are the most important vegetables; as of 2000, Tokyo supplied 32.5% of the Japanese leaf spinach sold at its central produce market.

With 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of [[cryptomeria]] and [[Chamaecyparis obtusa|Japanese cypress]], especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, Ōme, Okutama, Hachiōji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of lumber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers.

Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Presently, most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu Ōshima and Hachijōjima. [[Skipjack tuna]], [[nori]], and [[Carangidae|''aji'']] are among the ocean products.

[[Tourism in Tokyo]] is also a contributor to the economy.

Within [[Ōta, Tokyo|Ōta]], one of the 23 special wards, [[Tokyo International Airport]] (&quot;Haneda&quot;) offers mainly domestic flights. Outside Tokyo, [[Narita International Airport]], in [[Chiba Prefecture]], is the major gateway for international travelers to Japan and [[Japan Airlines]], [[All Nippon Airways]], [[Air Japan]] and [[Delta Air Lines]] all have a hub at this airport.

Various islands governed by Tokyo have their own airports. [[Hachijōjima]] ([[Hachijojima Airport]]), [[Miyakejima]] ([[Miyakejima Airport]]), and [[Izu Ōshima]] ([[Oshima Airport]]) have service to Tokyo International and other airports.

Rail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo, which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines. [[East Japan Railway Company|JR East]] operates Tokyo's largest railway network, including the [[Yamanote Line]] loop that circles the center of downtown Tokyo. Two organizations operate the subway network: the private [[Tokyo Metro]] and the governmental [[Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation]]. The metropolitan government and private carriers operate bus routes. Local, regional, and national services are available, with major terminals at the giant railroad stations, including [[Tokyo Station|Tokyo]], [[Shinagawa Station|Shinagawa]], and [[Shinjuku Station|Shinjuku]].

Expressways link the capital to other points in the Greater Tokyo area, the Kantō region, and the islands of [[Kyūshū]] and [[Shikoku]].

Other transportation includes taxis operating in the special wards and the cities and towns. Also long-distance ferries serve the islands of Tokyo and carry passengers and cargo to domestic and foreign ports.

[[Architecture in Tokyo]] has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] and later after [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|extensive firebombing in World War II]].&lt;ref name=spatial/&gt;  Because of this, Tokyo's current urban landscape is one of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.&lt;ref name=spatial&gt;Hidenobu Jinnai.

The '''Enzo Ferrari ''' is a [[V12 engine|12 cylinder]] [[rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|mid-engine]] [[berlinetta]] named after the company's founder, [[Enzo Ferrari]].  It was built in 2002 using [[Formula One]] technology, such as a [[Graphite-reinforced plastic|carbon-fibre]] body, F1-style [[electrohydraulic manual transmission|electrohydraulic shift transmission]], and [[reinforced carbon-carbon#Similar products|Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide]] (C/SiC) [[ceramic]] composite [[disc brake]]s. Also used are technologies not allowed in F1 such as active aerodynamics and traction control. After a [[downforce]] of {{convert|775|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} is reached at {{convert|355.6|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} the rear wing is actuated by computer to maintain that downforce.

The Enzo's [[V12 engine]] is the first of a new generation for Ferrari.  It is based on the architecture of the [[V8]] found in sister-company [[Maserati]]'s [[Maserati Quattroporte|Quattroporte]], using the same basic architecture and 104&amp;nbsp;mm (4.1&amp;nbsp;in) bore spacing.  This design will replace the former architectures seen in V12 and V8 engines used in most other contemporary Ferraris.  The 2005 [[Ferrari F430|F430]] is the second Ferrari to get a version of this new powerplant.

In 2004, American magazine ''[[Sports Car International]]'' named the Enzo Ferrari number three on their list of [[Sports Car International Top Sports Cars|Top Sports Cars of the 2000s]]. American magazine ''[[Motor Trend|Motor Trend Classic]]'' named the Enzo as number four in their list of the ten &quot;Greatest Ferraris of all time&quot;.

==Name==
Though officially known as the ''Enzo Ferrari'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferrari.com/English/GT_Sport%20Cars/Classiche/All_Models/Pages/Enzo_Ferrari.aspx Enzo Ferrari], www.Ferrari.com. Retrieved on 2009-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt; the car is sometimes referred to colloquially as the &quot;'''Ferrari Enzo'''&quot;, or simply as &quot;'''Enzo'''&quot; with no marque or other words attached.

Celebrating its first World Championship of the new Millennium, in Formula One, Ferrari built the Enzo to celebrate this achievement and the company named the car after its founder, Enzo Ferrari, who died in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/enzo.htm|title=How the Enzo Ferrari Works|publisher=How Stuff Works|last=Grabianowski|first=Edward|accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrariworld.com/FWorld/fw/index.jsp|title=Enzo Ferrari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The Enzo was initially announced at the 2002 [[Paris Motor Show]] with a limited production run of 349  and  at US $659,330.  The company sent invitations to existing customers, specifically, those who had previously bought the [[Ferrari F40]] and [[Ferrari F50]].  All 349 cars were sold in this way before production began.  Later, after numerous requests, Ferrari decided to build 50 more Enzos, bringing the total to 399. Before being unveiled at the Paris Motor show, the Enzo (that was used in the show) was flown from Italy to California to be filmed in ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]''. It was driven on a beach by actress [[Demi Moore]]. After filming was complete, the Enzo was flown to France to be in the Motor Show.&lt;ref&gt;According to ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'' director [[McG]]. ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'' DVD, special feature.&lt;/ref&gt; Enzos are listed as being built in 2003.

Ferrari built one more Enzo&amp;nbsp;— the 400th car&amp;nbsp;— and it was auctioned by [[Sotheby's]] Maranello Auction on June 28, 2005, to benefit survivors of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Tsunami]] for [[Euro|€]]950,000 ([[United States dollar|US$]]1,274,229), almost twice its list price.  This sum was presented to [[Pope Benedict XVI]], while former Ferrari [[Formula One]] driver [[Michael Schumacher]] gave the pope a steering wheel to commemorate the donation.  This wheel included a plaque which read, &quot;The Formula 1 World Champion's steering wheel to His Holiness Benedict XVI, Catholicism's driver.&quot;

The Enzo Ferrari typically trades above $1,000,000 (£500,000) at auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportscarmarket.com/profiles/2006/January/Ferrari/index.html|title=2005 Enzo Ferrari|last=Ahlgrim|first=Steve|accessdate=2007-03-04|publisher=[[Sports Car Market]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three prototype &quot;mules&quot; were built, M1, M2, and M3.  Each was bodied to look like a [[Ferrari 348|348]], even though the mules were built in 2000.  The third mule was offered for auction alongside the 400th Enzo in June, 2005, bringing €195,500 (US$236,300).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/3171.html|title=Ferrari M3 348 for sale|accessdate=2006-08-11|publisher= Supercars.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
===Engine===
{{Main|Ferrari Dino engine#V12}}
The Enzo is a [[RMR layout|mid-engined]] car with a 43.9/56.1 front/rear weight distribution.  The engine is Ferrari's [[Ferrari Dino engine|F140]] 65° [[V12 engine|V12]] with [[multi-valve|4 valves per cylinder]], [[dual overhead cam]]s and [[variable valve timing]].  [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] Motronic ME7 [[fuel injection]] is used and the engine is [[naturally aspirated]].  It displaces 5998&amp;nbsp;cc (366&amp;nbsp;in³) and produces {{Convert|660|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7800&amp;nbsp;rpm and {{Convert|657|Nm|lb·ft|abbr=on}} at 5500&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;How engine works&quot; /&gt;  The [[redline]] is 8000&amp;nbsp;rpm.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSportsCars&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = 2002 Ferrari Enzo | publisher = RSportsCars | url = http://www.rsportscars.com/eng/cars/ferrari_enzo.asp | accessdate = 2007-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chassis===
The Enzo has a [[semi-automatic transmission]] (also known as the F1 gearbox) using paddles to control an automated shifting and clutch mechanism, with LED lights on the steering wheel telling the driver when to change gears.  The gearbox has a [[shift time]] of just 150&amp;nbsp;milliseconds.  The transmission was a first generation &quot;clutchless&quot; design from the late 1990s, and there have been complaints about its abrupt shifting.&lt;ref name=&quot;How engine works&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paultan.org/archives/2006/06/26/vw-phases-out-automatics-makes-way-for-dsg/|title=Volkswagen makes way for DSG|accessdate=2006-08-11|publisher= Paul Tan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enzo Ferrari has 4 wheel independent suspension with push-rod actuated [[shock absorber]]s which can be adjusted from the cabin, complemented with [[anti-roll bar]]s at the front and rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/enzo2.htm| title=Turning Point| publisher=[[How Stuff Works]]| first=Edward| last=Grabianowski| accessdate=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enzo uses {{convert|483|mm|0|adj=on}} wheels and has {{convert|381|mm|0|adj=on}} [[Brembo]] [[disc brake]]s. The Enzo uses 19&quot; wheels held by a single lug nut and [[Bridgestone]] Potenza Scuderia RE050A tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted by **TIME AGO** |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/car/03q1/ferrari_enzo-auto_shows |title=Ferrari Enzo - Auto Shows |publisher=Car and Driver |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Enzo's extraordinary performance and price, the [[Ferrari F430#430 Scuderia|Ferrari 430 Scuderia]] (an improved version of Ferrari's standard F430 production car) is capable of lapping the Ferrari test track just as quickly as the Enzo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/apps/vdpcontainers/do/vdp/articleId=122823/pageNumber=1|title=First Drive: 2008 Ferrari 430 Scuderia|author=Simon Green|publisher=Edmunds|date=2007-09-30|accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evo (magazine)|Evo]] magazine tested the Enzo on the famed [[Nürburgring|Nordschleife Circuit]] and ran a 7:25.21 lap time. The Enzo in the test had a broken electronic damper.

==Enzo-based cars==
===Ferrari FXX===
{{Main|Ferrari FXX}}
[[Image:Ferrari FXX.jpg|thumb|Ferrari FXX]]
As the result of the Enzo, Ferrari has decided to use some of the technology developed for it in a small-scale program to get more feedback from certain customers for use in future car design as well as their racing program.  The core of this program is a car called the Ferrari FXX.  It is loosely based on the Enzo's design with a highly-tuned 6.3 litre version of the Enzo's engine putting out roughly {{convert|800|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}}.  The gearbox is new as well as the tires (custom-designed for this car by [[Bridgestone]]) and the brakes (developed by [[Brembo]]).  In addition, the car is fitted with extensive data-recording and telemetry systems to allow Ferrari to record the car's behavior.  This information will be used by Ferrari to develop their next sports car.

Like the Enzo, the car was sold to specially selected existing clients of Ferrari only; the initial price was €1.3 million.  Unlike the Enzo, the clients did not take delivery of the car themselves.  Rather, it is maintained by Ferrari and available for the client's use on various circuits as arranged by Ferrari and also during private track sessions.  The car is not expected to be street-legal or suitable for road use.

The Ferrari FXX program will continue until 2008/2009 with the Ferrari FXX Evoluźione.  The car will continue to be improved under the Evolution kit, which will continually adjust specifics to create more power, change gearing, and remove drag.  The 6262 cc V12 engine will be pushing out {{convert|860|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} at 9500 rpm.  There will be gearbox changes so that shift time will be reduced to 60 milliseconds per shift, a reduction of 20 milliseconds.  The car will also undergo aerodynamic changes and improvements to the traction control system. Its top speed is 227&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carautoportal.com/ferrari/ferrari-fxx.php Ferrari FXX Development&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After sending out feelers to its clients, American Ferrari collector, [[James Glickenhaus]] eventually agreed to back the project by commissioning the car as a modern homage to great Ferrari sports racing cars such as the [[Ferrari P|330 P3/4, 512 S, 312 P, and 333 SP]] on the last unregistered U.S.-spec Enzo chassis.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Beast of Turin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Car and Driver]]|issue=September 2006|pages=86–93|title=The Beast of Turin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The car was dubbed the Ferrari P4/5 by Pininfarina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/motoringpreviews/202264/ferrari_612_p45.html|title=Ferrari 612 P4/5|work=Autoexpress.co.uk|accessdate=August 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and retains the Enzo's drivetrain and [[vehicle identification number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrarip45.com|title=Ferrari P 4/5 by Pininfarina and James Glickenhaus|work=FerrariP45.com|accessdate=August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The car was unveiled at the 2006 [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance]] and appeared in the September issue of ''[[Car and Driver]]''.  The &quot;photos&quot; previously shown in ''[[AutoWeek]]'' and ''Octane'' were not close to what the car looks like.  After its unveiling at Pebble Beach, the P4/5 returned to Europe for high speed testing, press days, and an appearance at the [[Paris Auto Show]] in September.

Upon seeing P 4/5, Luca di Montezemolo felt that the car deserved to Ferrari P 4/5 by Pininfarina&quot;.  Ted West wrote an article in ''Car and Driver'' about how this came to be: &quot;The Beast of Turin&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Beast of Turin&quot;/&gt;

===Maserati MC12===
[[Image:Maserati.MC12.JPG|thumb|Maserati MC12]]
{{Main|Maserati MC12}}
The Maserati MC12 is a two-seat [[RMR layout|mid-engined]] sports car derivative of the Enzo Ferrari developed by [[Maserati]] while under control of Ferrari.  It was developed specifically to be [[homologation|homologated]] for racing in the [[FIA GT Championship]], with a minimum requirement of 25 road versions to be produced before the car could be allowed to compete.  Maserati built 50 units, all of which were presold to selected customers.  A further variation, the [[Maserati MC12#MC12 Corsa|MC12 Corsa]] is a track day car, similar to the [[Ferrari FXX]].

The Maserati MC12 has the same engine, chassis and gearbox as the Enzo but the only externally visible component from the Enzo is the windshield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/features.cfm/featureID/1060609.001/country/ecf/maserati/wcf-test-drive-maserati-mc12r-by-edo|title=World Car Fans test drive MC12|accessdate=2006-09-28|publisher=World Car Fans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupe/112_0506_maserati_mc12/|title=Motor Trend Road Test|accessdate=2006-10-02|publisher=Motor Trend}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MC12 is slower accelerating (0–100&amp;nbsp;km/h in 3.8 s) and has a lower top speed (330&amp;nbsp;km/h) or 208&amp;nbsp;mph and less drag coefficient (due to sharper nose and smoother curves) than the Enzo due to engine tuning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=118481&amp;Maserati|title=Carfolio: Maserati MC12|accessdate=2006-09-28|publisher=Carfolio}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the MC12 has lapped race tracks faster than the Enzo before, specifically on the UK motoring show [[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]], and the Nurburgring Nordschleife (at colder outside temperature).  However this could be attributed to the MC12's Pirelli PZero Corsa tires which have more grip than the Enzo's Bridgestone Scuderias&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/content/tgonbbc2/laptimes/thestig/|title=The Stig's lap times|publisher=Top Gear website|accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MC12 has sharper nose and smoother curves than Enzo.

{{Main|Maserati Birdcage 75th}}
The Maserati Birdcage 75th is a [[concept car]] created by automobile manufacturer [[Maserati]] and designed by [[Pininfarina]]. It was first introduced at the 2005 [[Geneva Auto Show]].  It draws inspiration from the [[Maserati Tipo 61|Maserati Tipo Birdcages]] of the 1960s and was made as a celebration of [[Pininfarina]]'s 75th [[anniversary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/content/features/stories/2005/06/stories/08/2.html|title=Maserati's bird of paradise|publisher=[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]|date=2005-06-01|accessdate=2006-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an evolution of the Enzo's MC12 cousin.

===Maserati MC12 Corsa===
{{Main|Maserati MC12 Corsa}}
[[Image:Maserati MC12 Corsa.jpg|thumb|left|Maserati MC 12 Corsa at the IAA 2007]]
The Maserati MC12 Corsa is a variant of the MC12 intended for [[racetrack]] use. In contrast to the race version of the MC12, of which street-legal versions were produced for homologation purposes, the MC12 Corsa is intended for private use, albeit restricted to the track, as the Corsa's modifications make it illegal to drive on the road.

The Corsa was developed directly from the MC12 GT1, which won the 2005 FIA GT Manufacturers Cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;maserati ultimate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maserati.com.au/default.asp?action=article&amp;ID=248&amp;KeyWords=Italian%2CGT|title=Maserati Launches its Ultimate Super car|publisher=[[Maserati]]|accessdate=2006-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was released in mid-2006, &quot;in response to the customer demand to own the MC12 racing car and fueled by the growth in track days, where owners can drive their cars at high speeds in the safety of a race track&quot;, as stated by Edward Butler, General Manager for Maserati in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RSportsCars&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsportscars.com/eng/cars/mc12_corsa.asp|title=RSportsCars: Maserati MC12 Corsa|accessdate=2006-09-28|publisher=RSportsCars}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;maserati ultimate&quot; /&gt; In similar fashion to the [[Ferrari FXX]], although the owners are private individuals, Maserati is responsible for the storage, upkeep, and maintenance of the cars, and they are only driven on specially organized [[track day]]s. Unlike the FXX, Corsas are not used for research and development, and are used only for entertainment.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Corsa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cars.ign.com/articles/711/711087p1.html|title=IGN: Maserati MC12 Corsa|accessdate=2006-10-02|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single MC12 Corsa has been modified by its owner to make it [[Street-legal vehicle|street-legal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;maserati ultimate&quot;/&gt;

Only twelve MC12 Corsas were sold to selected customers, each of whom paid €1&amp;nbsp;million (US$1.47&amp;nbsp;million) for the privilege. Another three vehicles were produced for testing and publicity purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSportsCars&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimatecarpage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/frame.php?file=car.php&amp;carnum=2798|title=Ultimate Car Page: Maserati MC12 Corsa|accessdate=2006-09-29|publisher=Ultimate Car Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Corsa shares its engine with the MC12 GT1; the powerplant produces {{convert|755|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} at 8000&amp;nbsp;rpm, {{convert|122|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} more than the original MC12.&lt;ref name=&quot;Autobild&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autobild.de/aktuell/meldungen/artikel.php?artikel_id=11654|title=Vorstellung Maserati MC12 Corsa |publisher=Autobild|accessdate=2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MC12 Corsa shares the GT1's shortened nose, which was a requirement for entry into the [[American Le Mans Series]]. The car was available in a single standard color, named &quot;Blue Victory&quot;, though the car's paint could be customized upon request.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSportsCars&quot; /&gt; The MC12 Corsa possesses steel/carbon racing brakes, but is not fitted with an [[anti-lock braking system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;maserati ultimate&quot; /&gt;

===Ferrari Millechili===
{{Main|Ferrari Millechili}}
Millechili (Italian for one thousand (mille) kilograms (chili)) is the code name for a sports car, to be manufactured by [[Ferrari]], that will borrow features from [[Formula One]] race cars. It will be a lightweight version of the Enzo Ferrari, using the [[Ferrari F430|F430]]'s aluminum space frame on a {{convert|104.3|in|mm|sing=on}} wheelbase. The V10 engine will exceed {{convert|600|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Production of around 300 cars is slated for 2010, with a base price of around US$500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted by **TIME AGO** |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/car_shopping/future_cars_2010_and_beyond/2010_ferrari_millechili_car_news |title=2010 Ferrari Millechili - Car News - Auto Reviews |publisher=Car and Driver |date= |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millechili is developed in collaboration with University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, faculty of Mechanical Engineering. [[Millechili Lab]] is a cross-project in which students are working on light-weight car design.

===Ferrari FXX Evoluzione===
{{Main|Ferrari FXX Evoluzione}}
The Ferrari FXX program will continue until 2008/2009. The car will continue to be improved under the Evolution kit, which will continually adjust specifics to create more power, change gearing, and lower the aerodynamic drag. The V12 engine will generate {{convert|860|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}} at 9500&amp;nbsp;rpm which boosts the top speed to {{convert|387|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}},  and the acceleration to 0–100&amp;nbsp;km/h in 2.5 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://topcarnews.splinder.com/post/14515354/Ferrari+FXX+Evluzione Ferrari FXX Evoluzione]&lt;/ref&gt; There will be gearbox changes so that shift time will be reduced to 60 milliseconds per shift, a reduction of 40 milliseconds. The car will also undergo aerodynamic changes and improvements to the traction control system.&lt;ref name=&quot;italiaspeed.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/ferrari/10/fxx_programme/2810.html|title=28.10.2007 FXX programme extended|accessdate=2007-10-30|work=italiaspeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
