==Etymology==
Tokyo was originally known as [[Edo]], meaning &quot;estuary&quot;.&lt;ref name=placenames&gt;Room, Adrian. ''Placenames of the World''. McFarland &amp; Company (1996), [http://books.google.com/books?id=PzIer-wYbnQC&amp;pg=PA360&amp;sig=X75YRM_z45rzt4ZcemXMFhn9uWs p360]. ISBN 0786418141.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name was changed to Tokyo (''Tōkyō'': ''tō'' (east) + ''kyō'' (capital)) when it became the imperial capital in 1868, in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital ('京') in the name of the capital city.&lt;ref name=placenames/&gt;  During the early [[Meiji period]], the city was also called &quot;Tōkei&quot;, an alternative pronunciation for the same Chinese characters representing &quot;Tokyo&quot;. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling &quot;Tokei&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tōkei&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==History==
{{Main|History of Tokyo}}
[[Image:Tokugawa 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]]]
Tokyo was originally a small fishing village named Edo.

It was first fortified by the [[Edo clan]], in the late 12th century.

In 1457, [[Ōta Dōkan]] built [[Edo Castle]]. In 1590, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] made Edo his base and when he became [[shogun]] in 1603, the town became the center of his nationwide military government. During the subsequent [[Edo period]], Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  |isbn=080148183X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became the de facto capital of Japan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  |first=Andre

  |isbn=0415354226
}}&lt;/ref&gt; even while the emperor lived in [[Kyoto]], the imperial capital.
After about 263 years, the shogunate was overthrown under the banner of [[Meiji Restoration|restoring imperial rule]]. In 1869, the 17-year-old [[Emperor Meiji]] moved to Edo. Tokyo was already the nation's political and cultural center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/PROFILE/overview01.htm
  |title=History of Tokyo
  |accessdate=2007-10-17
  |publisher=Tokyo Metropolitan Government
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the emperor's residence made it a ''de facto'' imperial capital as well with the former [[Edo Castle]] becoming the [[Kokyo|Imperial Palace]]. The [[Tokyo City|city of Tokyo]] was established, and continued to be the capital until it was abolished as a municipality in 1943 and merged with the &quot;Metropolitan Prefecture&quot; of Tokyo.

Central Tokyo, like [[Osaka]], has been designed since about 1900 to be centered around major train stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]]. This differs from many cities in the [[United States]] that are low-density and automobile-centric. Though [[Shuto Expressway|expressways]] have been built in Tokyo, the basic design has not changed.

Tokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century, but it recovered from both. One was the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]], which left 140,000 dead or missing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1421140/Tokyo-Yokohama-earthquake-of-1923 Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake of 1923]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the other was [[World War II]]. The [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945]], with 75,000 to 200,000 killed and half of the city destroyed, was almost as devastating as the atomic bombs of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Japan: A Social and Political History |author=Tipton, Elise K. |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:sto1012.jpg|left|thumb|Ginza during the allied occupation period]]
After the war, Tokyo was completely rebuilt, and was showcased to the world during the [[1964 Summer Olympics]]. The 1970s brought new high-rise developments such as [[Sunshine 60]], a new and controversial&lt;ref&gt;[http://tokyo-nrt.airports-guides.com/ &quot;Tokyo Narita International Airport (NRT) Airport Information (Tokyo, Japan)&quot;]. Retrieved on 11 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narita International Airport|airport]] at [[Narita]] in 1978 (some distance outside city limits), and a population increase to about 11 million (in the metropolitan area).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed [[Japanese asset price bubble|during a real estate and debt bubble]]. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's &quot;[[lost decade (Japan)|lost decade]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Tokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include [[Ebisu, Tokyo|Ebisu]] Garden Place, Tennozu Isle, [[Shiodome]], [[Roppongi Hills]], [[Shinagawa, Tokyo|Shinagawa]] (now also a [[Shinkansen]] station), and the [[Marunouchi]] side of [[Tokyo Station]]. Buildings of significance are demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as [[Omotesando Hills]].

Land reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the [[Odaiba]] area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of [[Tokyo Bay]] and measures about 90&amp;nbsp;km east to west and 25&amp;nbsp;km north to south. [[Chiba Prefecture]] borders it to the east, [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]] to the west, [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]] to the south, and [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]] to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area ({{lang|ja|多摩地域}}) stretching westwards.

[[Image:TokyoMetropolitanGovernmentOffice.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building]]]] Also within the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the [[Pacific Ocean]] directly south: the [[Izu Islands]], and the [[Ogasawara Islands]], which stretch more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;km away from the mainland. Because of these islands and mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far underrepresent the real figures for urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.

Under [[Japanese law]], Tokyo is designated as a ''to'' ({{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:都|都]]}}), translated as ''[[metropolis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Within Tokyo lie dozens of smaller entities, including many cities, the twenty-three special wards, districts, towns, villages, a quasi-national park, and a national park. The [[Special wards of Tokyo|twenty-three special wards]] ({{lang|ja|特別[[wiktionary:区|区]]}} -ku), which until 1943 comprised the [[Tokyo City|city of Tokyo]], are now separate, self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.

In addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities ([[wiktionary:市|市]] -shi), five towns ({{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:町|町]]}} -chō or machi), and eight villages ({{lang|ja|[[wiktionary:村|村]]}} -son or -mura), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building|headquarters]] are in the ward of [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]]. They govern all of Tokyo, including lakes, rivers, dams, farms, remote islands, and [[national parks]] in addition to its neon jungles, skyscrapers and crowded subways.

===Special wards===
[[Image:Tokyo Special Wards.png|thumb|right|A map of Tokyo's 23 Special wards]]
The [[Special wards of Tokyo|special wards]] (''tokubetsu-ku'') of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. On July 1, 1943, Tokyo City was merged with {{nihongo|Tokyo Prefecture|東京府|Tōkyō-fu}} forming the current &quot;metropolitan prefecture&quot;. As a result, unlike other [[wards of Japan|city wards]] in Japan, these wards are not part of any larger incorporated city.
Each ward is a [[Municipalities of Japan|municipality]] with its own elected mayor and assembly like the other cities of Japan. The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government.  Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.  To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/PROFILE/overview06.htm The Structure of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government] (Tokyo government webpage)&lt;/ref&gt;

The special wards of Tokyo are:

===Western Tokyo===
[[File:Cities in Western Tokyo Metropolis.png|thumb|right|A map of cities in western part of Tokyo]]
To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan.

While serving as &quot;[[Bedroom community|bed towns]]&quot; for those working in central Tokyo, some of these also have a local commercial and industrial base. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama Area or [[Western Tokyo]].

====Cities====
Twenty-six cities lie within the western part of Tokyo:
{|
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;

* [[Akiruno, Tokyo|Akiruno]]
* [[Akishima, Tokyo|Akishima]]
* [[Chōfu, Tokyo|Chōfu]]

* [[Nishitōkyō, Tokyo|Nishitōkyō]]
* [[Ōme, Tokyo|Ōme]]
* [[Tachikawa, Tokyo|Tachikawa]]
* [[Tama, Tokyo|Tama]]
|}

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachiōji, Tachikawa, Machida, Ōme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their plans to disperse urban functions away from central Tokyo.

====Districts, towns and villages====
The far west is occupied by the district (''gun'') of [[Nishitama, Tokyo|Nishitama]]. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, [[Mount Kumotori]], is 2,017&amp;nbsp;m high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takasu (1737&amp;nbsp;m), Odake (1266&amp;nbsp;m), and [[Mount Mitake|Mitake]] (929&amp;nbsp;m). [[Lake Okutama]], on the [[Tama River]] near [[Yamanashi Prefecture]], is Tokyo's largest lake.

===Islands===
[[Image:Hachijo-jima.JPG|thumb|[[Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park]]]]
Tokyo has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1850&amp;nbsp;km from central Tokyo. Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the metropolitan government in Shinjuku, local offices administer them.

The [[Izu Islands]] are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the [[Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park]]. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are [[Izu Ōshima]], [[Toshima Island|Toshima]], [[Niijima]], [[Shikinejima]], [[Kozushima]], [[Miyakejima]], [[Mikurajima]], [[Hachijojima]], and [[Aogashima]]. Izu Ōshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming [[Niijima, Tokyo|one village]].

The [[Ogasawara, Tokyo|Ogasawara]] Islands include, from north to south, [[Chichi-jima]], [[Nishinoshima]], [[Haha-jima]], [[Kita Iwo Jima]], [[Iwo Jima]], and [[Minami Iwo Jima]]. Ogasawara also administers two tiny outlying islands: [[Minami Torishima]], the easternmost point in Japan and at 1,850&amp;nbsp;km the most distant island from central Tokyo, and [[Okino Torishima]], the southernmost point in Japan. The last island is contested by the [[People's Republic of China]] as being only uninhabited rocks. The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but host [[Japanese Self-Defense Forces]] personnel. Local populations are only found on [[Chichi-jima]] and [[Haha-jima]]. The islands form the village of Ogasawara.

===National parks===
There are several national parks within Tokyo, among them:
* [[Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park]], around [[Mount Takao]] to the south of Hachiōji
* [[Ogasawara Islands|Ogasawara National Park]]. [[Wikipedia:As of|As of]] 2006, efforts were being made to make Ogasawara National Park a [[UNESCO]] natural [[World Heritage Site]].
* [[Ueno Park]], well known for its museums: [[Tokyo National Museum]], [[National Science Museum of Japan|National Science Museum]], [[Shitamachi Museum]] and [[The National Museum of Western Art|National Museum for Western Art]], among others. There are also art works and statues at several places in the park.

As of October 2007, the official [[intercensal estimate]] showed 12.79 million people in Tokyo with 8.653 million living within Tokyo's 23 wards.&lt;ref name=population/&gt; During the daytime, the population swells by over 2.5 million as workers and students commute from adjacent areas. This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]], [[Chūō, Tokyo|Chūō]], and [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]], whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4 million during the day.&lt;ref name=population/&gt;

The entire prefecture had 12,790,000 residents in October 2007 (8,653,000 in 23 wards), with an increase of over 3 million in the day. Tokyo is at its highest population ever, while that of the 23 wards peak official count was 8,893,094 in the 1965 Census, with the count dipping below 8 million in the 1995 Census.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} People continue to move back into the core city as land prices have fallen dramatically.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

As of 2005, the most common foreign nationalities found in Tokyo are Chinese (123,661), Korean (106,697), Filipino (31,077), American (18,848), British (7,696), Brazilian (5,300) and French (3,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following [[World War II]], many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as [[Osaka]] (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.

Tokyo was rated by the [[The Economist|Economist Intelligence Unit]] as the most expensive (highest [[Cost-of-living index|cost-of-living]]) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-01-31T113907Z_01_L312905_RTRUKOC_0_US-LIFE-CITIES.xml&amp;archived=False |title=Oslo is world's most expensive city: survey |publisher=Reuters |date=January 31, 2006 |accessdate=February 1}} (inactive).&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis is for living a corporate executive lifestyle, with items like a detached house and several automobiles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Tokyo had 8,460&amp;nbsp;ha (20,900&amp;nbsp;acres) of agricultural land as of 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maff.go.jp/esokuhou/sei200305.pdf |title=Statistics on Cultivated Land Area |authors=Horticulture Statistics Team, Production Statistics Division, Statistics and Information Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries |date=July 15, 2003 |accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]], placing it last among the nation's prefectures. The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo. Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture. [[Komatsuna|Japanese leaf spinach]] and [[spinach]] are the most important vegetables; as of 2000, Tokyo supplied 32.5% of the Japanese leaf spinach sold at its central produce market.

With 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of [[cryptomeria]] and [[Chamaecyparis obtusa|Japanese cypress]], especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, Ōme, Okutama, Hachiōji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of lumber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers.

Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Presently, most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu Ōshima and Hachijōjima. [[Skipjack tuna]], [[nori]], and [[Carangidae|''aji'']] are among the ocean products.

[[Tourism in Tokyo]] is also a contributor to the economy.

==Cityscape==
[[Architecture in Tokyo]] has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] and later after [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|extensive firebombing in World War II]].&lt;ref name=spatial/&gt;  Because of this, Tokyo's current urban landscape is one of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.&lt;ref name=spatial&gt;Hidenobu Jinnai.
