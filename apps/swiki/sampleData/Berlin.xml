'''Berlin''' ({{IPA-en|bɜrˈlɪn}}; {{IPA-de|bɛɐ̯ˈliːn|-|de-Berlin.ogg}}) is the [[Capital of Germany|capital]] city and one of 16 [[States of Germany|states]] of [[Germany]]. With a population of 3.4 million people,&lt;ref name=&quot;Population&quot; /&gt; Berlin is Germany's largest city. It is the second [[Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|most populous city proper]] and the eighth [[Largest urban areas of the European Union|most populous urban area]] in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?ref_id=cmptef01103&amp;id=18|title=Population des villes et unités urbaines de plus de 1 million d'habitants de l'Union européenne|author=[[INSEE]]|accessdate=17 August 2008|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in northeastern Germany, it is the center of the Berlin-[[Brandenburg]] [[Metropolitan Area]], comprising 5 million people from over 190 nations.&lt;ref name=LUZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanaudit.org/CityProfiles.aspx|title=City Profiles Berlin|work=Urban Audit|accessdate=20 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically embedded in the [[European Plain]]s, Berlin is influenced by a [[temperate]] seasonal climate.

First documented in the 13th century, Berlin was successively the capital of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (1701–1918), the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918), the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–1933) and the [[Third Reich]] (1933–1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/germanunification.html|title=Documents of German Unification, 1848–1871|work=Modern History Sourcebook|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1920s Berlin|1920s]], Berlin was the third largest municipality in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=23505|title=Topographies of Class: Modern Architecture and Mass Society in Weimar Berlin (Social History, Popular Culture, and Politics in Germany).|work=/www.h-net.org|accessdate=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], the city was divided; [[East Berlin]] became the capital of [[East Germany]] while [[West Berlin]] became a de facto [[West German]] [[exclave]], surrounded by the [[Berlin Wall]] (1961–1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/62202/Berlin-Wall|title=Berlin Wall|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[German reunification]] in 1990, the city regained its status as the capital of all Germany hosting 147 foreign embassies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germany.info/relaunch/info/archives/background/berlin.html|title=Berlin{{ndash}} Capital of Germany|work=German Embassy in Washington|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magazine-deutschland.de/en/artikel-en/article/article/das-diplomatische-berlin.html|title=Diplomatic Berlin|work=Deutschland Online|accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Berlin}}

The name ''Berlin'' is of unknown origin, but may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' &quot;swamp&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=3411062525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ZLB-Berliner Ansichten-Januar.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Berlin in 1688]]

The earliest evidence of settlements in today's Berlin central areas is a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192.&lt;ref name = &quot;zycwaq&quot;&gt;{{citenews|work=Associated Press|title=Berlin dig finds city older than thought|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first written mention of towns in the area of present-day Berlin dates from the late 12th century. The settlement of [[Spandau]] is first mentioned in 1197, and [[Köpenick]] in 1209, though these areas did not join Berlin until 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/tourismus/sehenswuerdigkeiten.en/00175.html|title=Spandau Citadel|work=Berlin tourist board|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. [[Cölln]] on the [[Fischerinsel]] is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the [[Spree]] in what is now called the [[Nikolaiviertel]], is referenced in a document from 1244.&lt;ref name = &quot;zycwaq&quot;/&gt; The former is considered to be the &quot;founding date&quot;. From the beginning, the two cities formed an economic and social unit. In 1307, the two cities were united politically. Over time, the twin cities came to be known simply as Berlin.

In 1435, [[Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg|Frederick I]] became the [[prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which he ruled until 1440.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html|title=The Hohenzollern Dynasty|work=Antipas|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II Irontooth]], established Berlin as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the [[Hohenzollern]] family ruled until 1918 in Berlin, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and finally as [[German emperor]]s. In 1448 citizens rebelled in the &quot;Berlin Indignation&quot; against the construction of a new royal palace by Frederick II Irontooth. This protest was not successful, however, and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. In 1451 Berlin became the royal residence of the Brandenburg electors, and Berlin had to give up its status as a free [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became [[Lutheran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smp-protein.de/SMPConference/berlin.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060818100934/http://www.smp-protein.de/SMPConference/berlin.htm|archivedate=18 August 2006|title=Berlin Cathedral|work=SMPProtein|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th to 19th centuries===
[[File:Friedrich Zweite Alt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frederick the Great]] (1712–1786) was one of Europe's [[enlightened monarch]]s.]]

The [[Thirty Years' War]] between 1618 and 1648 had devastating consequences for Berlin. A third of the houses were damaged and the city lost half of its population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/germany/bra30.html|title=Brandenburg during the 30 Years War|work=WHKMLA|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], known as the &quot;Great Elector&quot;, who had succeeded his father [[George William of Brandenburg|George William]] as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance. With the [[Edict of Potsdam]] in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French [[Huguenot]]s. More than 15,000 Huguenots went to Brandenburg, of whom 6,000 settled in Berlin. By 1700, approximately 20 percent of Berlin's residents were French, and their cultural influence on the city was immense. Many other immigrants came from [[Bohemia]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], and [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]].

[[File:Berlin Unter den Linden Victoria Hotel um 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin became the capital of the German Empire in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years. (Unter den Linden in 1900)]]

With the coronation of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]] in 1701 as king (in [[Königsberg]]), Berlin became the new capital of the Kingdom of Prussia (instead of [[Königsberg]]); this was a successful attempt to centralize the capital in the very outspread Prussian Kingdom, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1740 Frederick II, known as [[Frederick the Great]] (1740–1786), came to power. Berlin became, under the rule of the philosophically oriented Frederick II, a center of [[the Enlightenment]]. Following [[First French Empire|France's]] victory in the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] marched into Berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city. In 1815 the city became part of the new [[Province of Brandenburg]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main rail hub and economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, outlying suburbs including [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], [[Moabit]], and several others were incorporated into Berlin. In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded German Empire. On 1 April 1881 it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.

===20th century===
[[File:Potsdamer Platz 1945.jpg|thumb|Berlin in ruins after [[World War II]] (Potsdamer Platz, 1945).]]

At the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, the Weimar Republic was proclaimed in Berlin. In 1920, the [[Greater Berlin Act]] incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. This new area encompassed Spandau and Charlottenberg in the west, as well as several other areas that are now major municipalities. After this expansion, Berlin had a population of around four million. During the Weimar era, Berlin became internationally renowned as a center of cultural transformation, at the heart of the [[Roaring Twenties]].

On 30 January 1933 ([[Machtergreifung]]), [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] came to power. Nazi rule destroyed Berlin's Jewish community, which had numbered 170,000 before 1933. After the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom in 1938, thousands of the city's German Jews were imprisoned in the nearby [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] or, in early 1943, were shipped to [[death camp]]s, such as [[Auschwitz]]. During the Second World War, large parts of Berlin were destroyed in [[Battle of Berlin (air)|the 1943–45 air raids]] and during the [[Battle of Berlin]]. Among the hundreds of thousands who died during the Battle for Berlin, an estimated 125,000 were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Clodfelter|first=Michael|title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts- A Statistical Reference to Casualty and Other Figures, 1500-2000|edition=2nd|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2002|isbn=0786412046}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[end of World War II in Europe|end of the war in Europe]] in 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zones]] into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the Western Allies (the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and France) formed [[West Berlin]], while the [[Soviet Union|Soviet sector]] formed [[East Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t297c01.html|title=Agreement to divide Berlin|work=FDR-Library|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlinermauer.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Berlin Wall]] in 1986, painted on the western side. People crossing the so-called &quot;death strip&quot; on the eastern side were at risk of being shot.]]

All four allies retained shared responsibility for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the [[USSR|Soviet Union]] imposed a [[Berlin Blockade|blockade]] on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet controlled territory. The allies successfully overcame the blockade by the [[Berlin airlift]], which flew in food and other supplies to the city from 24 June 1948 to 11 May 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|title=Berlin Airlift / Blockade|work=Western Allies Berlin|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in West Germany, and eventually included all of the American, British, and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the [[Marxist-Leninist]] German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but for all practical purposes, it was assimilated to the Federal Republic of Germany without actually being a part of it. West Berlin issued its own postage stamps which were often the same as West German postage stamps but with the additional word 'Berlin' added. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British, and French airlines.

[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.]]

The founding of the two German states increased [[Cold War]] tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory. East Germany, however, proclaimed East Berlin (which it described only as &quot;Berlin&quot;) as its capital, a move that was not recognized by the Western powers. Although half the size and population of West Berlin, it included most of the historic center of the city. The West German government, meanwhile, established itself provisionally in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/1945.en.html|title=Berlin official website; History after 1945|work=City of Berlin|accessdate=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tensions between east and west culminated in the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] between East and West Berlin and other barriers around West Berlin by East Germany on 13 August 1961 and were exacerbated by a tank standoff at [[Checkpoint Charlie]] on 27 October 1961. West Berlin was now [[de facto]] a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany.

[[File:Berlin skyline 2009w.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Berlin Mitte in the 21st century.]]

Berlin was completely separated. It was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other only through strictly controlled checkpoints. For most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was no longer possible. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power agreement]] guaranteed access across East Germany to West Berlin and ended the potential for harassment or closure of the routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga5-710903.htm|title=Ostpolitik: The Quadripartite Agreement of September 3, 1971|work=US Berlin Embassy|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, pressure from the East German population broke free across the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989, which was subsequently mostly demolished. Not much is left of it today; the [[East Side Gallery]] in [[Friedrichshain]] near the ''Oberbaumbrücke'' over the Spree preserves a portion of the Wall. Democracy and market economy changed East Germany and East Berlin.

On 3 October 1990 the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin became the German capital according to the unification treaty. In June 1991 the German Parliament, the [[Bundestag]], voted to move the (West) German capital back from Bonn to Berlin. In 1999, the German parliament and government began their work in Berlin.

==Geography==
[[File:Berlin.svg|thumb|Natural and built environment.]]

Berlin is located in eastern Germany, about {{convert|70|km|sp=us}} west of the border with Poland in an area with marshy terrain. The Berlin–Warsaw ''Urstromtal'' (ice age melt water flow), between the low Barnim plateau to the north and the Teltow plateau to the south, was formed by water flowing from melting ice sheets at the end of the last ice age. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In [[Spandau]], Berlin's westernmost borough, the Spree meets the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and [[Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&amp;spn=0.060339,0.085316&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en|title=Satellite Image Berlin|work=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Über den Dächern von Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|View over central Berlin.]]

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim plateau, while most of the boroughs [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow plateau. The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin ''Urstromtal'' and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. The highest elevations in Berlin are the [[Teufelsberg]] and the [[Müggelberge]]. Both hills have an elevation of about {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The Teufelsberg is in fact an artificial pile of rubble from the ruins of World War II.

===Climate===
[[File:Potsdam view from above.jpg|thumb|The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes]]

Summers are warm with average high temperatures of {{convert|22|-|25|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|12|-|14|C|F}}. Winters are cold with average high temperatures of {{convert|4|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|-2|to|0|C|F}}. Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with heat stored by the city's buildings. Temperatures can be {{convert|4|C-change|sigfig=1}} higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;www.weather.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual precipitation is {{convert|570|mm|in|sp=us}} with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through March, but snow cover does not usually remain for long. The recent winter of 2009/2010 was an exception as there was a permanent snow cover from late December till early March.&lt;ref name=worldweather&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweather.org/016/c00059.htm|title=Climate figures|work=World Weather Information Service|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cityscape==
[[File:Berlin night.jpg|thumb|right|Berlin along the Spree river and the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] by night.]]

The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the twentieth century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin&amp;#8203;—&amp;#8203;the 1871 German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany&amp;#8203;—&amp;#8203;initiated ambitious construction programs, each with its own distinctive character. Berlin was devastated by bombing raids during World War II and many of the old buildings that escaped the bombs were eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s in both West and East. Much of this destruction was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads.

In the eastern part, many ''[[Plattenbau]]ten'' can be found, reminders of [[Eastern Bloc]] ambitions to create complete residential areas with fixed ratios of shops, kindergartens and schools. Berlin's unique recent history has left the city with a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings.

===Architecture===
[[File:Berlin - Haus des Lehrers &amp; BCC.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Haus des Lehrers&quot; and Congress Hall at Alexanderplatz.]]

The [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is the second-tallest structure in the European Union at {{m to ft|368|precision=0}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the Socialist Classicism Style of the [[Stalin]] era. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. The previously built-up part in front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological scene.

[[File:Brandenburger Tor 2005 006.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Brandenburg Gate]].]]
The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division. It has recently undergone a restoration.

The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany. It also appears on German [[euro]] coins (10&amp;nbsp;cent, 20&amp;nbsp;cent, and 50&amp;nbsp;cent). The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament, renovated in the 1950s after severe World War II damage. The building was again remodeled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

[[File:PotsdamerplatzBerlin.JPG|thumb|right|[[Potsdamer Platz]] at dusk.]]
The [[Gendarmenmarkt]], a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin whose name dates back to the Napoleonic occupation of the city, is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the German Cathedral. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

The [[Berliner Dom]], a Protestant cathedral and the third church on this site, is located on the [[Museum Island|Spree Island]] across from the site of the [[Berliner Stadtschloss]] and adjacent to the [[Lustgarten]]. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. Like many other buildings, it suffered extensive damage during the Second World War. The [[Cathedral of St. Hedwig]] is Berlin's [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral.

[[File:ReichstagDomeInside.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Inside the glass dome of the Reichstag.]]

[[Unter den Linden]] is a tree lined east-west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street and part of [[Humboldt University]] is located there. [[Friedrichstraße]] was Berlin's legendary street during the [[Roaring Twenties]]. It combines twentieth century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

[[Potsdamer Platz]] is an entire quarter built from scratch after 1995 after the Wall came down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html|title=Construction and redevelopment since 1990|work=Senate Department of Urban Development|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the [[Gemäldegalerie (Berlin)|Gemäldegalerie]], and is flanked by the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Berliner Philharmonie]]. The [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], a [[Holocaust]] memorial, is situated to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/arts/design/09holo.html?ex=1162962000&amp;en=272335914d8b80d6&amp;ei=5070|title=A Forest of Pillars, Recalling the Unimaginable|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=18 August 2008|first=Nicolai|last=Ouroussoff|date=9 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area around Hackescher Markt is home to the fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the Hackesche Höfe, a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. Oranienburger Straße and the nearby [[New Synagogue (Berlin)|New Synagogue]] were the center of Jewish culture before 1933, and they have regained that status today.

[[File:Schloss Charlottenburg 2005 282.JPG|thumb|[[Schloss Charlottenburg]] is the largest existing palace in Berlin.]]

The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as central East-West-Axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately half-way from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Near by on Tauentzienstraße is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous &quot;[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!&quot; speech, is situated in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].

West of the center, [[Schloss Bellevue]] is the residence of the German President. [[Schloss Charlottenburg]], which was burnt out in the Second World War and largely destroyed, has been rebuilt and is the largest surviving historical palace in Berlin.

The [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower at the fair area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators, and has a restaurant {{m to ft|55|precision=0|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{m to ft|126|precision=0|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

==Government==
[[File:Reichstag building Berlin view from west before sunset.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] is the site of the German parliament.]]

Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany and is the seat of the [[President of Germany]], whose official residence is [[Schloss Bellevue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundespraesident.de/en Bundespräsident Horst Köhler], www.bundespraesident.de. Retrieved 12 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Since German reunification on 3 October 1990, it has been one of the three city states, together with [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], among the present sixteen states of Germany. The [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] (&quot;federal council&quot;) is the representation of the Federal States (''Bundesländer'') of Germany and has its seat at the former Prussian [[Herrenhaus]] (House of Lords). Though most of the ministries are seated in Berlin, some of them, as well as some minor departments, are seated in Bonn, the former capital of West Germany. The [[European Union]] invests in several projects within the city of Berlin. Infrastructure, education and social programs are co-financed with budgets taken from EU cohesion funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erasmuspc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=303&amp;Itemid=61 URBAN regeneration, a European Commission initiative], ErasmusPC. Retrieved 12 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===City state===
[[File:Wowereit2008.JPG|upright|thumb|Governing Mayor since 2001, [[Klaus Wowereit]]]]

The city and state parliament is the [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]] (''Abgeordnetenhaus''), which currently has 141 seats. Berlin's [[executive (government)|executive]] body is the Senate of Berlin (''Senat von Berlin''). The Senate of Berlin consists of the [[List of mayors of Berlin|Governing Mayor]] (''Regierender Bürgermeister'') and up to eight senators holding ministerial positions, one of them holding the official title &quot;Mayor&quot; (''Bürgermeister'') as deputy to the Governing Mayor. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the [[Berlin state election, 2001|2001 state election]] and won another term in the [[Berlin state election, 2006|2006 state election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-berlin.de/wahlen/|title=Berlin state election, 2006|work=Der Landeswahlleiter für Berlin|accessdate=17 August 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the city (''Oberbürgermeister der Stadt'') and Prime Minister of the Federal State (''Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes''). The office of Berlin's Governing Mayor is in the [[Rotes Rathaus|Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall)]]. Since 2001 this office has been held by [[Klaus Wowereit]] of the SPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/050516/wowereit.html|title=The Glamor Guy|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Europe]]|date=8 May 2005|accessdate=17 August 2008}} See also: {{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/23/world/europe/23wowereit.html?ex=1161489600&amp;en=2129daf9965bf613&amp;ei=5070|title=Berlin Mayor, Symbol of Openness, Has National Appeal|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=17 August 2008|first=Mark|last=Landler|date=23 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's government is based on a coalition between the Social Democratic Party and The Left.

The total annual state budget of Berlin in 2007 exceeded €20.5 ($28.7) billion including a budget surplus of €80 ($112) million. The figures indicate the first surplus in the history of the city state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,527721,00.html Berlin schafft erstes Etatplus seit dem Krieg](German), SpiegelOnline. Retrieved February, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to increasing growth rates and tax revenues, the Senate of Berlin calculates an increasing budget surplus in 2008. The total budget includes an estimated amount of €5.5 ($7.7) bn, which is directly financed by either the German government or the German Bundesländer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/berlin/article199345/Sarrazin_Keine_neuen_Schulden_mehr_ab_2008.htm|title=Sarrazin: Keine neuen Schulden mehr ab 2008|first=Joachim|last=Fahrun|work=[[Berliner Morgenpost]]|date=10 June 2008|accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainly due to reunification-related expenditures, Berlin as a German state has accumulated more debt than any other city in Germany, with the most current estimate being €60 ($84)bn in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1983556,00.html|title=Debt-Laden Berlin Goes to Court For Federal Aid|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=29 April 2006|accessdate=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Boroughs and localities of Berlin}}
[[File:BerlinDistricts.svg|thumb|right|Map of Berlin's twelve boroughs and their localities.]]

Berlin is subdivided into [[Boroughs and localities of Berlin|twelve boroughs]] (''Bezirke''), but before [[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform]] there were 23. Each borough is subdivided into a number of localities (''Ortsteile''), which represent the traditional [[urbanized]] areas that inhabitants identify with. Some of these have been rearranged several times over the years. At present the city of Berlin consists of 95 such localities. The localities often consist of a number of city neighborhoods (usually called ''[[Kiez]]'' in the [[Berlin dialect]]) representing small residential areas.

Each borough is governed by a Borough Council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five Councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') and a Borough Mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The Borough Council is elected by the Borough Assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). The boroughs of Berlin are not independent municipalities. &lt;!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --&gt; The power of borough governments is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough mayors form the Council of Mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), led by the city's Governing Mayor, which advises the Senate.

The localities have no government bodies of their own, even though most of the localities have historic roots in older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. The subsequent position of locality representative (''Ortsvorsteher'') was discontinued in favor of borough mayors.

===Sister cities===
Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.&lt;ref name=Berlinsistercities&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/staedteverbindungen/index.en.html|title=Berlin's international city relations|work=Berlin Mayor's Office|accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Town twinning between Berlin and other cities began with Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification and later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the West, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.

There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, Conference of the World's Capital Cities.

==Demographics==
{{See also|Berlin population statistics}}
[[File:Berlin Population Development 1880-2007.svg|thumb|Berlin's population 1880–2007.]]

As of September 2009, the city-state of Berlin had a population of 3,439,100 registered inhabitants &lt;ref name=&quot;Population&quot; /&gt; in an area of {{convert|891.82|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;statoffice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-berlin.de/|title=Berlin statistical figures|work=[[Amt für Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg]]|accessdate=19 August 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's population density was 3,848 inhabitants per km² (9,966/sq&amp;nbsp;mi). The [[urban area]] of Berlin stretches beyond the city limits and comprises about 3.7&amp;nbsp;million people while the metropolitan area of the Berlin-Brandenburg region is home to about 4.3&amp;nbsp;million in an area of {{convert|5370|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The [[Larger Urban Zones (LUZ) in the European Union|Larger Urban Zone]] was home to over 4.9 million people in an area of 17,385&amp;nbsp;km² in the year 2004.&lt;ref name=LUZ/&gt;

[[File:800px-PeopleMyfest.jpg|thumb|left|Crowd in [[Kreuzberg]]]]

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, following the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France, the city responded with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin. The act increased the area of Berlin from {{convert|66|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|883|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and the population from 1.9&amp;nbsp;million to 4&amp;nbsp;million.
&lt;br /&gt;
Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin have initiated waves of immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, Berlin is home to about 250,000 [[Turks in Germany|Turks]] (especially in [[Kreuzberg]], [[Neukölln]] and [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], a locality in the [[Boroughs of Berlin|borough]] of [[Berlin-Mitte|Mitte]])&lt;ref name=&quot;250k Turks&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/berlin-shish-and-sauerkraut-to-go-448678.html|title=Berlin: Shish And Sauerkraut To Go|first=Andrew|last=Spooner|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2007-05-13|accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.

In the 1990s the ''Aussiedlergesetze'' made immigration from the former [[Soviet Union]] possible.

Berlin is home to more than 50 theaters.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot;/&gt; The [[Deutsches Theater]] in Mitte was built in 1849–50 and has operated continuously since then, except for a one-year break (1944–45) due to the Second World War. The [[Volksbühne]] on Rosa Luxemburg Platz was built in 1913–14, though the company had been founded already in 1890. The [[Berliner Ensemble]], famous for performing the works of [[Bertolt Brecht]], was established in 1949, not far from the Deutsches Theater. The [[Schaubühne]] was founded in 1962 in a building in Kreuzberg, but moved in 1981 to the building of the former Universum Cinema on Kurfürstendamm.

[[File:CurryWurst.jpg|thumb|The [[currywurst]] was invented in Berlin]]

Frederick the Great (king of Prussia) had a role in establishing some of Berlin's traditional foods after he ordered his subjects to eat primarily cucumbers and potatoes in the 18th century, because they were cheap and fit the frugal Prussian lifestyle. They remain favorites in Berlin along with rustic and hearty dishes using pork, goose, fish, peas, beans and potatoes.

Typical Berliner dishes include [[Currywurst]] (invented in Berlin in 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/spicy-sausage-that-is-worthy-of-a-shrine-in-berlin-1772530.html|title=Spicy sausage that is worthy of a shrine in Berlin|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|first=Tony|last=Paterson|date=15 August 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the corresponding [[Ketwurst]], [[Eisbein]] and the [[Berliner (pastry)|Berliner]] (which however is known as a {{lang|de|''Pfannkuchen''}}, not a {{lang|de|''Berliner''}}, in Berlin).

Berlin has two commercial airports. [[Tegel International Airport]] (TXL), the busier, and [[Schönefeld International Airport]] (SXF) handled more than 21 million passengers combined in 2009. Together they serve 166 destinations (123 European) in 50 countries (summer 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notizie.virgilio.it/notizie/economia/2010/3_marzo/24/aeroporti_nel_2011_unico_scalo_a_berlino_da_27_mln_di_2,23530301.html|title=n 2009 nei 3 scali berlinesi sono transitati 21 mln passeggeri|work=notizie.virgilio.it|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tegel lies within the city limits and is the European hub of [[Air Berlin]]. Whereas Schönefeld handles mainly low-cost-aviation and is situated just outside Berlin's south-eastern border in the state of Brandenburg.

Berlin's airport authority aims to transfer all of Berlin's air traffic in November 2011 to a newly built airport at Schönefeld, to be renamed [[Berlin-Brandenburg International Airport|Berlin Brandenburg Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin-airport.de/EN/BBI/|title=Airport Berlin Brandenburg International|work=Airports Berlin|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; City authorities aim to establish a European aviation hub with a gateway to Asia.

===Utilities===
[[File:Berlin HKW Mitte.jpg|thumb|upright|Heizkraftwerk Mitte.]]

Berlin's power supply is mainly provided by the Swedish firm [[Vattenfall]] and relies more heavily than other electricity producers in Germany on [[lignite]] as an energy source. Because burning lignite produces harmful emissions, Vattenfall has announced a commitment to shift towards reliance on cleaner, [[renewable energy]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2006/05/30/a0166|title=Abgase tiefer gelegt|first=Nick|last=Reimer|work=[[Die Tageszeitung|taz]]|date=30 May 2006|accessdate=18 August 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former West Berlin's electricity supply was provided by thermal power stations. To facilitate buffering during load peaks, [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulators]] were installed during the 1980s at some of these power stations. These were connected by static inverters to the power grid and were loaded during times of low power consumption and unloaded during times of high consumption.

In 1993 the power connections to the surrounding areas, which had been capped in 1951, were restored. In the western districts of Berlin, nearly all power lines are underground cables; only a 380&amp;nbsp;kV and a 110&amp;nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380-kV electric line]] was constructed when West Berlin's electrical system was a totally independent system and not connected to those of East or West Germany. This has now become the backbone of the whole city's power system.

Carmaker [[Daimler AG]] and utility RWE AG are going to begin a joint electric car and [[charging station]] test project in Berlin called &quot;E-Mobility Berlin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/apwire/3e8bc7ee811bd771be83c3bf1960bbbc.htm]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
