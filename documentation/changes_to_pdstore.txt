java.sql.Blobs should now be byte[]s (you can also convert serializable objects to byte arrays 
I believe)
java.sql.Timestamps should now be java.util.Dates


There is now only 1 usable load method in pdCache. load(GUID instanceId, GUID typeId) 
is the load to use as load(GUID instanceId) is not yet implememnted.
There is no longer a facility to remove an instance from the data base (removeInstance) 
as that does always make sense.
RemoveLink() might be able to remove most things.
There is no getGUID, but getInstance may work instead.

We now have a native guid class, so that has also changed a bit, but legacy methods are 
there.

Lastly there are no more intercession features on the cache, other than addlink and 
removelink(and so on) which are able to change the model.

Also, pdgen can be used, on its own or called from another class, such that the cache 
is able to be specified.
