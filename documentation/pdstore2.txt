The Java class structure should be used also for other platforms

Classes generated by PDGen satisfy the specification for Obervable Data Containers:
1. getX for all accessible attributes
2. setX for all accessible attributes with maximum multiplicity 1 (equal to remove and add)
3. addX for all accessible attributes with maximum multiplicity greater than 1
4. removeX for all accessible attributes
5. addAddXListener for all accessible attributes
6. addRemoveXListener for all accessible attributes
7. addGetXListener for all accessible attributes (possibly without guarantee)

The type of instances is indentified through the role of any types link that is connected to the instance.
So to identify the type, at least one link needs to be there. This might require a temporary "phantom tuple" if there is no link yet.
