'''London''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|l|ʌ|n|d|ən}}) is the [[capital (political)|capital]] of [[England]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (UK). It is Britain's largest and most populous [[metropolitan area]].

[[File:Thames Panorama, London - June 2009.jpg|thumb|left|The name ''London'' may derive from the [[River Thames]]|alt=Wide river flanked by tall buildings on either side. There are a number of small boats and one large battleship in the centre of the river. The rooftop dome of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] is visible in the skyline to the right]]
The [[etymology of London|etymology of ''London'']] is uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_139&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mills|2001|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an ancient name and can be found in sources from the 2nd century. It is recorded c. 121 as ''[[Londinium]]'', which points to [[Romano-British]] origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_139&quot;/&gt; The earliest attempted explanation, now disregarded, is attributed to [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_139&quot;/&gt; The name is described as originating from [[Lud son of Heli|King Lud]], who had allegedly taken over the city and named it ''Kaerlud''.&lt;ref name=london_009&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/books/chapters/02-1st-ackro.html?ex=1225339200&amp;en=b9c2c11ad6e1f435&amp;ei=5070|title='London'|last=Ackroyd|first=Peter|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2008-10-28 | date=2001-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1899 it was commonly accepted that the name was of [[Celts|Celtic]] origin and meant ''place belonging to a man called *Londinos''; this explanation has since been rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_139&quot;/&gt; [[Richard Coates]] put forward an explanation in 1998 that it is derived from the pre-Celtic [[Old European hydronymy|Old European]] ''*(p)lowonida'', meaning 'river too wide to ford', and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the [[River Thames]] which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, ''*Lowonidonjon''.&lt;ref name=coates&gt;{{Citation|last=Coates|first=Richard|year=1998|title=A new explanation of the name of London|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|volume=96|issue=2|pages=203–229|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-968X.00027|doi=10.1111/1467-968X.00027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1889 the name officially only applied to the [[City of London]] but since then it has also referred to the [[County of London]] and now [[Greater London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_140&quot;/&gt;

===Prehistory and antiquity===
[[File:London 1300 Historical Atlas William R Shepherd (died 1934).PNG|thumb|left|By 1300 the [[City of London|City]] was still confined within the walls|alt=]]
Although there is evidence of scattered [[Britons (historic)|Brythonic]] settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 43 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=Roman London |last=Perring |first=Dominic |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0203231333|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lasted for just seventeen years and around 61, the [[Iceni]] tribe led by [[Boudica|Queen Boudica]] stormed it, burning it to the ground.&lt;ref name=london_010&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/timeline/romanbritain_timeline_noflash.shtml|title=British History Timeline&amp;nbsp;— Roman Britain|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next, heavily planned incarnation of the city prospered and superseded [[Colchester]] as the capital of the [[Roman Britain|Roman province]] of [[Britannia]] in 100. At its height during the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000. By the 7th century, the [[Anglo-Saxons]] had created a new settlement called [[Anglo-Saxon London|Lundenwic]] over a mile (2&amp;nbsp;km) upstream from the old Roman city, around what is now [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].&lt;ref name=london_011&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Lundenwic.htm|title=The early years of Lundenwic|publisher=The [[Museum of London]]|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that there was a harbour at the mouth of the [[River Fleet]] for fishing and trading, and this trading grew, until the city was overcome by the [[Viking]]s and forced to move east, back to the location of the Roman ''Londinium'', in order to use its walls for protection.&lt;ref name=london_012&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/Onlineresources/RWWC/themes/1295/1288|title=Viking and Danish London|publisher=The [[Museum of London]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viking attacks continued to increase, until 886 when [[Alfred the Great]] recaptured London and made peace with the Danish leader, [[Guthrum]].&lt;ref name=london_013&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Permanent/medieval/Themes/1033/1035/default.htm|title=Medieval London&amp;nbsp;— Vikings|publisher=The [[Museum of London]]|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Saxon city of Lundenwic became ''Ealdwic'' (&quot;old city&quot;), a name surviving to the present day as [[Aldwych]], which is in the modern [[City of Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2fIgAAAAMAAJ |page=xiii |title=London |author=George Hamilton Cunningham |year=1927 |publisher=J.

[[Cnut the Great|Canute]] took control of the English throne in 1016, controlling the city and country until 1035, when his death resulted in a reversion to [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] control under his pious stepson [[Edward the Confessor]], who re-founded [[Westminster Abbey]] and the adjacent [[Palace of Westminster]].&lt;ref name=london_014&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/edward_confessor.shtml|title=Edward the Confessor (c.1003–1066)|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, London had become the largest and most prosperous city in England, although the official [[seat of government]] was still at [[Winchester]].

In 1097, [[William II of England|William II]] began the building of [[Westminster Hall]], close by the abbey of the same name.

===Early modern===
[[File:Great Fire London.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Fire of London]] destroyed many parts of the city in 1666|alt=]]
During the [[Tudor period]] the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] produced a gradual shift to [[Protestantism]], with much of London passing from church to private ownership.&lt;ref name=pevsner&gt;[[Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''London I: The Cities of London and Westminster'' rev. edition,1962, Introduction p 48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercantilism]] grew and monopoly trading companies such as the [[British East India Company]] were established, with trade expanding to the [[New World]]. London became the principal [[North Sea]] port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt;

In the 16th century [[William Shakespeare]] and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the [[Elizabethan theatre|theatre]]. By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an [[assassination]] attempt on [[James I of England|James I]] in Westminster, through the [[Gunpowder Plot]] on 5 November 1605.&lt;ref name=london_023&gt;{{Citation |title=James I |last=Durston |first=Christopher|year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0415077796 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; London was [[Bubonic plague|plagued]] by disease in the early 17th century,&lt;ref name=london_024&gt;{{Citation|url=http://urbanrim.org.uk/plague%20list.htm |title=&quot;A List of National Epidemics of Plague in England 1348–1665&quot; |publisher=Urbanrim.org.uk |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.&lt;ref name=london_025&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/plague/story.html Story of the plague].

In the east, the [[Port of London]] expanded downstream.

In 1762 [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] acquired [[Buckingham Palace|Buckingham House]] and it was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was dogged by [[crime]] and the [[Bow Street Runners]] were established in 1750 as a professional police force.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.pbs.org/kqed/demonbarber/madding/thieftaker.html Thief Taker, Constable, Police]&quot;.

===Late modern and contemporary===
[[File:LondonBombedWWII full.jpg|thumb|A London street hit during [[the Blitz]] of World War II|alt=]]
London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925.&lt;ref name=london_030&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/i-m/london4.html|title=London: The greatest city |publisher=Channel4.com|accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; London's overcrowded conditions led to [[cholera]] epidemics,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/themes/publichealth/cholera.aspx Hidden extras: cholera comes to Victorian London]&quot;.

The University of North Carolina and Pembroke.&lt;/ref&gt; Rising [[traffic congestion]] led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] oversaw infrastructure expansion. It was replaced in 1889 by the [[London County Council]], London's first elected city-wide administration. [[The Blitz]] and other bombing by the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' during [[World War II]] killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across London. Immediately after the war, the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] were held at the original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], at a time when the city had barely recovered from the war.

In 1951 the [[Festival of Britain]] was held on the [[South Bank]]. The [[Great Smog of 1952]] led to the [[Clean Air Act 1956]], which ended the &quot;[[pea soup fog|pea-souper]]&quot; fogs for which London had been notorious. From the 1950s onwards, London became home to a large number of immigrants, largely from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as [[Jamaica]], India, [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]], making London one of the most diverse cities in Europe.

Starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide [[youth culture]], exemplified by the [[Swinging London]] subculture associated with [[Carnaby Street]]. The role of trendsetter was revived during the [[punk rock|punk]] era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new [[Greater London Council]] was created. During [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], London was subjected to [[terrorism|terrorist]] attacks by the [[Provisional IRA]]. Racial inequality was highlighted by the [[1981 Brixton riot]]. Greater London's population declined steadily in the decades after [[World War II]], from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to [[Port of Felixstowe|Felixstowe]] and [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury]], with the [[London Docklands]] area becoming a focus for regeneration.

The [[Thames Barrier]] was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the [[North Sea]]. The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, which left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration. In 2000, London-wide government was restored, with the creation of the [[Greater London Authority]]. To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the [[Millennium Dome]], [[London Eye]] and [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millenium Bridge]] were constructed. On 7 July 2005, several [[London Underground]] trains and a bus were bombed in a [[7 July 2005 London bombings|series of terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref name=london_031&gt;{{Citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/london_blasts/what_happened/html/default.stm|title=7 July Bombings: Overview |publisher=BBC News | location = London |accessdate=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CityHallLondon2007.JPG|thumb|The [[Greater London Authority]] is based in [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]], Southwark|alt=]]
The administration of London is formed of two tiers—a city-wide, strategic tier and a local tier. City-wide administration is coordinated by the [[Greater London Authority]] (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.&lt;ref name=london_032&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/|title=About the Greater London Authority|publisher=London Government|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLA consists of two elected components; the [[Mayor of London]], who has executive powers, and the [[London Assembly]], who scrutinise the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject his budget proposals each year.

The headquarters of the GLA is [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]], [[Southwark]]; the current mayor is [[Boris Johnson]]. The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the [[London Plan]], which as of mid-2009 is being revised, for final publication in 2011. The local authorities are the councils of the 32 [[London borough]]s and the [[City of London Corporation]].&lt;ref name=london_035&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london/links.jsp|title=Links to other websites&amp;nbsp;— London boroughs|publisher=London Government|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, [[social work|social services]], local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as [[Waste disposal authorities in London|waste management]], a provided through joint arrangements.

[[Police|Policing]] in Greater London, with the exception of the [[City of London]], is provided by the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police Force]], overseen by the [[Metropolitan Police Authority]]. The City of London has its own police force&amp;nbsp;– the [[City of London Police]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Policing&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/policing.jsp|title=Policing|publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Transport Police]] are responsible for police services on [[National Rail]] and [[London Underground]] services in the capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;BTP&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.btp.police.uk/about_us/areas.aspx|title=Areas|publisher=British Transport Police|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National government===
London is an important city because the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] is located around
the [[Palace of Westminster]]. Many government departments are located close to Parliament, particularly along [[Whitehall]], including the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister's]] residence at [[10 Downing Street]].&lt;ref name=london_036&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page1.asp|title=10 Downing Street&amp;nbsp;— Official Website|publisher=10 Downing Street|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Parliament is often referred to as the &quot;Mother of Parliaments&quot; (although this ''[[sobriquet]]'' was first applied to England itself by [[John Bright]])&lt;ref name=london_037&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/96021.stm |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2008-06-06 |date=1998-06-03 |title=UK Politics: Talking Politics&amp;nbsp;— The 'Mother of Parliaments'}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it has been the model for most other [[parliamentary system]]s, and its Acts have created many other parliaments.&lt;!-- **Incomplete sentence** There are 74 [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) from London, who correspond to local parliamentary [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Greater London|constituencies]] in the national [[British House of Commons|Parliament]] by .&lt;ref name=london_038&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/4293078.stm|title=London: Ethnic vote |date=30 September 2005|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these 74 MPs, 44 are from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], 21 are [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], 8 are [[Liberal Democrats]] and one is from the [[Respect&amp;nbsp;– The Unity Coalition|RESPECT]] party.--&gt;

===Scope===
[[File:Central London Andh.svg|thumb|Map of Central London|alt=]]
[[Greater London]] is the top-level administrative subdivision covering London. The small, ancient [[City of London]] at its core once contained the whole settlement, but as the urban area grew the [[Corporation of the City of London|City Corporation]] resisted attempts to amalgamate it with its suburbs, causing &quot;London&quot; to be defined in a number ways for different purposes; and the situation was once open to legal debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;chancery&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Beavan|first=Charles|coauthors=Bickersteth, Harry|title=Reports of Cases in Chancery, Argued and Determined in the Rolls Court|publisher=Saunders and Benning|year=1865|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YFYDAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty percent of Greater London is covered by the [[London postal district|London]] post town, within which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.&lt;ref name=london_042&gt;{{Citation|last=Stationery Office|title=The Inner London Letter Post|publisher=H.M.S.O|year=1980|isbn=0102515808|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=map_post&gt;{{citation|title=London Postcode and Administrative Boundaries|publisher=Geographers' A-Z Map Company|author=Geographers' A-Z Map Company|year=2008|edition=6|isbn=9781843485926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are omitted and some places just outside are included. The area within the orbital [[M25 motorway]] is normally what is referred to as 'London'.&lt;ref name=london_043&gt;{{Citation|last=Mail|first=Royal|title=Address Management Guide|publisher=Royal Mail|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Greater London boundary has been [[List of Greater London boundary changes|aligned to it]] in places.&lt;ref name=london_044&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19930441_en_1.htm|title=The Essex, Greater London and Hertfordshire (County and London Borough Boundaries) Order|year=1993|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its position was formed through [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]], making its status as ''[[de facto]]'' capital a part of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|UK's unwritten constitution]].

===Topography===
[[File:London SPOT 1005.jpg|thumb|West and central London seen from [[SPOT (satellites)|SPOT satellite]]|alt=]]
Greater London covers an area of {{convert|1579|km2|sqmi}}, an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 4,542 people per square kilometre. A larger area, referred to as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration covers an area of  {{convert|8382|km2|sqmi}} has a population of 12,653,500 and a population density of 1,510 people per square kilometre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.dgcl.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/lu_pour_vous/les_grandes_metropol/downloadFile/attachedFile/metropolislondres.pdf?nocache=1254397828.63 |title=Metropolis: 027 London, World Association of the Major Metropolises |date= |accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  London's primary geographical feature is the [[River Thames|Thames]], a [[navigable river]] which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The [[Thames Valley]] is a [[floodplain]] surrounded by gently rolling hills including [[Parliament Hill, London|Parliament Hill]], [[Addington Hills]], and [[Primrose Hill]]. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive [[marshland]]s; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.&lt;ref name=london_065&gt;{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=M9qvtYYhRtAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=thames+%22iron+age%22+london+wide+geography+shallow+marsh&amp;ots=wVDtRsVF-V&amp;sig=GFqR9QKs45u-ggfYI0dcCA3GUzc#PPA10,M1|title=''London: A History'', by Francis Sheppard page 10.|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Victorian era]] the Thames has been extensively [[Thames Embankment|embanked]], and many of its London [[tributary|tributaries]] now flow [[Subterranean rivers of London|underground]]. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.&lt;ref name=london_066&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/flooding/?version=1&amp;lang=_e|title=Flooding|publisher=UK [[Environment Agency]]|accessdate=2006-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat has increased over time due to a slow but continuous rise in [[Tide|high water]] level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-[[glacier|glacial]] [[isostatic rebound|rebound]].&lt;ref name=london_067&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/yourenv/eff/1190084/natural_forces/sealevels/?version=1&amp;lang=_e|title=&quot;Sea Levels&quot; – UK Environment Agency|publisher=[[Environment Agency]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, a decade of work began on the construction of the [[Thames Barrier]] across the Thames at [[Woolwich]] to deal with this threat. While the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=David|last=Adam|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/mar/31/thames-flood-barrier-london|title=Thames Barrier gets extra time as London's main flood defence|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2009-03-31|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of the United Kingdom}}

London has a [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|marine climate]] ([[Koppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), like much of the British Isles, so the city rarely sees extremely high or low temperatures. Summers are warm with a July high of {{convert|22.8|C|1}} and low of {{convert|14.0|C|1}}.&lt;ref name = GreenwichStats /&gt; But temperatures can exceed {{convert|25|°C|°F}} on many days, and in almost every year they exceed {{convert|30|°C|°F}} on some days. The highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|38|°C|0}} &lt;ref name=&quot;AverageWeatherLondon&quot;&gt;{{Citation
  |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003790
  |title=Average Conditions, London, United Kingdom
  |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]
  |accessdate=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 10 August 2003 during the [[2003 European heat wave]].

Winters in London are chilly, but rarely below freezing (although in recent years this has been questionable) with daytime highs around {{convert||5°C|°F}}&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|8|°C|°F}}, while spring has mild  days and cool evenings.&lt;ref name=&quot;AverageWeatherLondon&quot; /&gt; The lowest ever recorded temperature was {{convert|-21.1|°C|0}} in January 1795. Autumn is usually mild but often unsettled as colder air from the arctic and warmer air from the tropics meet. London is a relatively dry city with regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year, with an average of {{convert|583.6|mm|in}} every year. This is lower than many cities such as [[New York City|New York]], [[Paris]], [[Sydney]] and around the same as [[San Francisco]] and even [[Jerusalem]]. 

London receives an average of only 1461 hours of sunshine every year.&lt;ref name = GreenwichStats /&gt;

Snow is relatively uncommon, particularly because [[urban heat island|heat from the urban area]] can make London up to 5&amp;nbsp;°C (9&amp;nbsp;°F) warmer than the surrounding areas in winter. Some snowfall, however, is usually seen up to a few times a year. The [[February 2009 Great Britain and Ireland snowfall]] was the heaviest London had seen for 18 years.

London is in [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Hardiness zone]] 9, and [[Hardiness zone|AHS Heat Zone 2]].&lt;ref name=london_069&gt;{{Citation

[[Tornado]]s are rare, but the [[Kensal Green]] area of the city was hit by the [[2006 London tornado]] causing £10 million of damage and injuring 6 people. In the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th, London was noted for its dense fogs and smogs. Following the deadly [[Great Smog of 1952]], the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] was passed, leading to the decline of such severe pollution in the capital.&lt;ref name=london_070&gt;{{Citation

London's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names, such as [[Bloomsbury]], [[Mayfair]], [[Wembley]] and [[Whitechapel]]. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or [[Metropolitan boroughs of the County of London|former boroughs]].

Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without current official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 [[London borough]]s in addition to the ancient City of London.&lt;ref name=london_071&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/boroughs.jsp|title=London boroughs&amp;nbsp;— London Life, GLA|publisher=London Government|accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=london_072&gt;{{Citation|last=Dogan|first=Mattei|coauthors=John D.

The [[West End of London|West End]] is London's main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists.&lt;ref name=london_075&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1608619.stm |title=West End still drawing crowds |work=BBC |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-06-06 | date=2001-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[West (London sub region)|West London]] includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds.&lt;ref name=london_076&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2006/apr/17/tax.g2|title=Super Rich|date=17 April 2006|publisher=The Guardian Money|accessdate=2008-06-07 | location=London | first=James | last=Meek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average price for properties in [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|Kensington and Chelsea]] is £894,000 with similar average outlay in most of [[Central London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;London's Properties&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://rbkc.gov.uk/Planning/localdevelopmentframework/ldf_hs_appendix_a2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Price of Properties.|publisher=Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture in London|List of tallest structures in London}}
[[File:30 St Mary Axe - The Gherkin from Leadenhall St - Nov 2006.jpg|thumb|London's architecture ranges from very old to modern]]
London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular [[architectural]] style, having been built over a long period of time. Notable recent buildings are the 1980s skyscraper [[Tower 42]], the [[Lloyd's building]] with services running along the outside of the structure, and the 2004 [[30 St Mary Axe|Swiss Re building]], known as ''&quot;the Gherkin&quot;''. London's generally low-rise nature makes these skyscrapers and others such as [[One Canada Square]] and its neighbours at [[Canary Wharf]] and the [[BT Tower]] in [[Fitzrovia]] very noticeable from a distance.

High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]]. Nevertheless, there are plans for more skyscrapers in [[Central London]] ''(see [[Tall buildings in London]])'', including the 72-storey [[Shard London Bridge|&quot;Shard of Glass&quot;]], which will be one of the tallest buildings in Europe. Older buildings are mainly [[brick]] built, most commonly the yellow [[London stock brick]] or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster [[molding (decorative)|mouldings]].&lt;ref name=london_077&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=A1&amp;xml=/property/2008/03/27/lpgreen127.xml|title=Eco homes: Wooden it be lovely... ?|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=2008-10-12 | location=London | first=Sarah | last=Lonsdale | date=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], are constructed from [[Portland stone]]. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white [[stucco]] or whitewashed buildings. Few structures pre-date the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of 1666, except for a few trace [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains, the [[Tower of London]] and a few scattered [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] survivors in the City. [[Christopher Wren|Wren]]'s late 17th century churches and the financial institutions of the 18th and 19th centuries such as the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]] and the [[Bank of England]], to the early 20th century [[Old Bailey]] and the 1960s [[Barbican Estate]] form part of the varied architectural heritage.
[[File:Buckingham Palace and Victoria Monument - September 2006.jpg|left|thumb|[[Buckingham Palace]] is the official residence of the British monarch|alt=]]
The disused, but soon to be rejuvenated, 1939 [[Battersea Power Station]] by the river in the southwest is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of [[Victorian architecture]], most notably [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]] and [[Paddington railway station|Paddington]].&lt;ref name=london_078&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Paddington_Station.html|title=Paddington Station.|publisher=Great Buildings|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The density of London varies, with high employment density in the [[Central London|central area]], high residential densities in [[inner London]] and lower densities in the [[Outer London|suburbs]].

In the dense areas, most of the concentration is achieved with medium- and [[high-rise]] buildings. London's [[skyscraper]]s such as [[30 St Mary Axe|&quot;Gherkin&quot;]], [[Tower 42]], the [[Broadgate Tower]] and [[One Canada Square]] are usually found in the two financial districts, the [[City of London]] and [[Canary Wharf]]. Other notable modern buildings include [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]] in [[Southwark]] with its distinctive oval shape,&lt;ref name=london_079&gt;{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2129199.stm|title=Inside London's new 'glass egg'|date= 16 July 2002|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Library]] in [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]]/[[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]]. What was formerly the [[Millennium Dome]], located by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now used as an entertainment venue known as [[The O2 (London)|The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].

[[The Monument]] in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the [[Great Fire of London]], which originated nearby. [[Marble Arch]] and [[Wellington Arch]], at the north and south ends of [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] respectively, have royal connections, as do the [[Albert Memorial]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[Kensington]]. [[Nelson's Column]] is a nationally recognised monument in [[Trafalgar Square]], one of the focal points of the centre.

===Parks and gardens===
{{Main|Parks and open spaces in London|Royal Parks of London}}
The largest parks in the central area of London are the [[Royal Parks of London|Royal Parks]] of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], its neighbour [[Kensington Gardens]] at the western edge of [[Central London]] and [[Regent's Park]] on the northern edge.&lt;ref name=london_080&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/kensington_gardens/|title=Kensington Gardens|year=2008|publisher=The Royal Parks|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regent's Park contains [[London Zoo]], the world's oldest scientific zoo, and is located near the tourist attraction of [[Madame Tussauds]] Wax Museum.&lt;ref name=london_081&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.madametussauds.com/London/About.aspx|title=Madame Tussauds&amp;nbsp;— Official website|publisher=Madame Tussauds|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=london_082&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.tourist-information-uk.com/madame-tussauds.htm|title=Madame Tussauds&amp;nbsp;— Tourist Information|publisher=Tourist Information UK|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Primrose Hill]] to the north of Regent's Park is a popular spot to view the city skyline.

Some more informal, semi-natural open spaces also exist, including the {{convert|320|ha|acre|sing=on}} [[Hampstead Heath]] of [[North London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Parks_and_open_spaces/Hampstead_Heath/|title=City of London Corporation Hampstead Heath|publisher=City of London Corporation|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This incorporates [[Kenwood House]], the former [[stately home]] and a popular location in the summer months where classical musical concerts are held by the lake, attracting thousands of people every weekend to enjoy the music, scenery and fireworks.&lt;ref name=london_086&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.00100200800k00800f|title=Kenwood House |publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
{{Main|Demography of London}}
{{TableLondonTop21BirthCountry}}&lt;!--- Ref name=Pop2001 ---&gt;
With increasing industrialisation, London's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world until overtaken by New York in 1925. Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].

Transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,&lt;ref name=london_121&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/|title=Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the [[London Overground]] network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The [[public transport]] network is administered by [[Transport for London]] (TfL) and is one of the most extensive in the world. [[Cycling in London|Cycling]] is an increasingly popular way to get around London. The [[London Cycling Campaign]] lobbies for better provision.&lt;ref name=london_122&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.lcc.org.uk/|title=London Cycling Campaign|date=20 November 2006|publisher=Rosanna Downes|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB) or ''[[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]]'' was created. [[Transport for London]] (TfL), is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the [[Mayor of London]].&lt;ref name=stat_tfl&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp#transport|title=How do I find out about transport in London? |publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buses and trams===
[[File:Routemaster bus alongside new bus.jpg|thumb|right 250px|The red [[double-decker bus]] is an iconic symbol of London]]
London's [[London buses|bus network]] is one of the largest in the world, running 24 hours a day, with 8,000 buses, 700 bus routes, and over 6 million passenger journeys made every weekday. In 2003, the network's ridership was estimated at over 1.5 billion passenger trips per annum, more than the Underground.&lt;ref name=london_130&gt;{{Citation |author=[[Transport for London]] |title=London Buses |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/1548.aspx |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around £850 million is taken in revenue each year.

===Air===
[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5 - Passenger area.jpg|thumb|right|[[London Heathrow Airport]] is the [[World's busiest airport|busiest airport in the world]] for international traffic &lt;ref name=london_135&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/|title=BAA Heathrow: Official Website|publisher=BAA|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=]]
London is a major international air transport hub with the largest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word ''London'' in their name, but most traffic passes through only five. [[London Heathrow Airport]], in [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]], West London, is the [[World's busiest airport|busiest airport in the world]] for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, [[British Airways]].&lt;ref name=london_135 /&gt; In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened,&lt;ref name=london_137&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.heathrow-airport-uk.info/heathrow-airport-terminal-5.htm|title=Heathrow Airport Terminal 5|publisher=TMC Ltd|accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plans are already being considered for a sixth terminal&lt;ref name=london_138&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/portal/site/heathrow/menuitem.2ea84de4d9bc8a0ca4b12871120103a0/%3bjsessionid=DNAfOXj7g3r3fk1j9NlWANpydf0hhlQvi8LcmzuRluuyU0u2FTlo!-949195938|title=About Heathrow|publisher=BAA Heathrow|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Roads===
[[File:Buses at Piccadilly Circus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Traffic congestion in Central London]]
Although the majority of journeys involving [[Central London]] are made by [[public transport]], car travel is common in the suburbs. The [[London Inner Ring Road|inner ring road]] (around the city centre), the [[A406 road|North]] and [[A205 road|South Circular]] roads (in the suburbs), and the outer orbital [[motorway]] (the [[M25 motorway|M25]], outside the built-up area) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into [[inner London]]. The M25 is the longest ring-road motorway in the world at {{convert|195.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name=london_143&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/travel/m25/m25_facts.shtml |title=Beds, Herts and Bucks Travel&amp;nbsp;— All you need to know about the M25 |publisher=BBC |date=1988-08-17 |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the [[London Ringways|Ringways Plan]]) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s. In 2003, a [[London congestion charge|congestion charge]] was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay £8 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of congested Central London.&lt;ref name=london_144&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/roadusers/congestioncharge/whereandwhen/|title=Charging Zone | Transport for London | Where and when|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=london_145&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/6741.aspx|title=Who pays what | Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a vastly reduced season pass which is renewed monthly and is cheaper than a corresponding bus fare.&lt;ref name=london_146&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/6735.aspx|title=Residents | Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; London is notorious for its traffic congestion, with the M25 motorway the busiest stretch in the country. The average speed of a car in the rush hour is 10.6&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name=london_147&gt;{{Citation|accessdate=2009-09-01|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/mar/16/boris-johnson-congestion-charge|title= Boris Johnson mulls 'intelligent' congestion charge system for London|publisher=The Guardian | first=Hélène | last=Mulholland | date=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Main|Education in London}}
[[File:UCL Portico Building.jpg|thumb|[[University College London]] is part of the [[University of London]]|alt=]]
Home to a range of universities, colleges and schools, London has a student population of about 378,000 and is a centre of [[research and development]]. Most primary and secondary schools in London follow the [[Education in England|same system as the rest of England]]—comprehensive schooling.
With 125,000 students, the [[University of London]] is the largest contact teaching university in the United Kingdom and in Europe.&lt;ref name=london_148&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.london.ac.uk/aboutus|title=About the University|date=2006-02-20|publisher=University of London|accessdate=2006-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises 20 colleges as well as several smaller institutes each with a high degree of autonomy.

Constituent colleges have their own [[University and college admissions|admissions]] procedures, and are effectively universities in their own right, although most degrees are awarded by the University of London rather than the individual colleges.

[[File:Brunel university entrance.jpg|thumb|[[Brunel University]] is one of the many universities in London|alt=]]
A number of colleges are dedicated to the fine arts, including the [[Royal College of Music]], [[Royal College of Art]], and [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]]. London's other universities, such as [[Brunel University]], [[City University, London|City University]], [[London Metropolitan University]], [[Middlesex University]], [[University of East London]], [[University of the Arts London]], [[University of Westminster]], [[Kingston University]] and [[London South Bank University]] are not part of the University of London but are still leaders in their field and popular choices among students both nationally and internationally. Some were [[Institute of technology|polytechnics]] until they were granted university status in [[Further and Higher Education Act, 1992|1992]], and others which were founded much earlier. Imperial College London left the federal University of London in 2007.

Since the merger of [[University of North London]] and [[London Guildhall University]] in 2003, [[London Metropolitan University]] is the largest unitary university in the capital, with over 34,000 students from 155 countries.&lt;ref name=london_157&gt;[http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/o90402_3.pdf About London Met] London Metropolitan University, August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; London is also known globally for its business education, harbouring several top-rated business schools: [[London Business School]], [[Cass Business School]] and [[Imperial College Business School]].&lt;ref name=london_158&gt;{{Citation|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/global-mba-rankings|title=Global MBA Rankings 2009|publisher= Financial Times|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition there are three international universities: [[Schiller International University]], [[Richmond University]] and [[Regent's College]].

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of London}}
===Accent===
The London accent long ago acquired the [[Cockney]] label, and was similar to many accents of the [[South East of England]], of which Cockney [[rhyming slang]] is a part. The accent of a 21st century 'Londoner' varies widely; what is becoming more and more common amongst the under 30s however is some fusion of Cockney, [[Received Pronunciation]], and a whole array of 'ethnic' accents, in particular Caribbean, which form an accent labelled [[Jafaican|Multicultural London English]] (MLE).&lt;ref name=&quot;MCLE&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/jafaican-and-tikkiny-drown-out-the-east-ends-cockney-twang-473688.html|title=Jafaican and Tikkiny drown out the East End's Cockney twang|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|date=2006-04-11|work=The Independent|accessdate=2008-08-22 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dickens by Watkins detail.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Charles Dickens]] (1812–1870)]]
London has been the setting for many works of literature. The literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly [[Hampstead]] and (since the early 20th century) [[Bloomsbury]]. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist [[Samuel Pepys]], noted for his eyewitness account of the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]], [[Charles Dickens]], whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London, and [[Virginia Woolf]], regarded as one of the foremost [[modernist literature|modernist]] literary figures of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;London in Literature&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/speccoll/guides/london/londoninliterature.shtml|title=London in Literature,|publisher=Bryn Mawr College|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums and art galleries===
{{Main|List of museums in London}}
[[File:Natural History Museum London Jan 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Natural History Museum]].]]
London is [[List of museums in London|home to many museums]], galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major [[tourist attraction]]s as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the [[British Museum]] in [[Bloomsbury]], in 1753. Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. In 1824 the [[National Gallery]] was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in [[Trafalgar Square]]. In the latter half of the nineteenth century the locale of [[South Kensington]] was developed as &quot;[[Albertopolis]]&quot;, a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are located there: the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (for the [[applied arts]]), the [[Natural History Museum]] and the [[London Science Museum|Science Museum]]. The national gallery of British art is at [[Tate Britain]], originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art; in 2000 this collection moved to [[Tate Modern]], a new gallery housed in the former [[Bankside Power Station]].

===Music===
London is one of the major [[Classical music|classical]] and [[popular music]] capitals of the world and is home to major music corporations, such as [[EMI]], as well as countless bands, musicians and industry professionals. London is home to many orchestras and concert halls such as the [[Barbican Arts Centre]] (principal base of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]), [[Cadogan Hall]] ([[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]) and the [[Royal Albert Hall]] ([[BBC Promenade Concerts]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;London's Concerts&quot; /&gt; London's two main opera houses are the [[Royal Opera House]] and the [[Coliseum Theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;London's Concerts&quot; /&gt; London is home to the UK's largest [[pipe organ]], at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Other significant instruments are found at the cathedrals and major churches. Several [[conservatoire]]s are located within the city: [[Royal Academy of Music]], [[Royal College of Music]], [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] and [[Trinity College of Music]].
[[File:BBC Proms 31.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Albert Hall]] hosts concerts and musical events|alt=]]

London has numerous venues for rock and pop concerts, including large arenas such as [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]], [[Wembley Arena]] and the [[The O2 arena (London)|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Arena]], as well as numerous mid-size venues, such as [[Brixton Academy]], [[Hammersmith Apollo]] and the [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;London's Concerts&quot; /&gt; London also hosts many [[music festivals]], including the [[O2 Wireless Festival]]. London is home to the first and original [[Hard Rock Cafe]] and the [[Abbey Road Studios]] where [[the Beatles]] recorded many of their hits. In the 1970s and 1980s, musicians like [[David Bowie]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[Ian Dury|Ian Dury and the Blockheads]], [[the Kinks]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Who]], [[Madness (band)|Madness]], [[the Jam]], [[the Small Faces]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[the Police]], [[the Cure]], [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] and [[Sade (band)|Sade]], took the world by storm, deriving their sound from the streets and rhythms vibrating through London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Top40&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2006/04/06/garycrowley_londontop40_feature.shtml|title=London's top 40 artists|date=2006-04-06|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] London|accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London was instrumental in the development of [[punk music]],&lt;ref name=london_172&gt;{{Citation|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=77:204|work=allmusic|title=Punk|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with figures such as the [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Top40&quot;/&gt; and [[Vivienne Westwood]] all based in the city. More recent artists to emerge from the London music scene include [[Bananarama]], [[Bush (band)|Bush]], [[East 17]], [[Siouxie and the Banshees]], the [[Spice Girls]],  [[Jamiroquai]], [[the Libertines]], [[Babyshambles]], [[Bloc Party]], [[Coldplay]] and [[Amy Winehouse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scene&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.londonbc.co.uk/history-of-music-in-london.html|title=History of music in London|publisher=The London Music Scene|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; London is also a centre for urban music. In particular the genres [[UK garage]], [[drum and bass]], [[dubstep]] and [[grime (music)|grime]] evolved in the city from the foreign genres of [[hip hop]] and [[reggae]], alongside local [[drum and bass]]. Black music station [[BBC 1Xtra]] was set up to support the rise of homegrown urban music both in London and the rest of the UK.

In the 80's London was the main city in the new wave of British [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] era which made bands like [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Motörhead]] famous all around the world.
